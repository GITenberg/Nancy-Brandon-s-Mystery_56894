<span>JUST A LITTLE LOVE</span></h2>


<p>They both were carefully folding garments&mdash;Nancy
sort of caressed the few dainty little
silk things while her mother placed tissue
paper between the folds of her tan tailored
skirt, and then laid it gently in the steamer
trunk.</p>

<p>“I can’t help feeling a little guilty, Nancy
dear,” she murmured. “To go all the way
over there without my darling daughter.”
The next garment was laid down, and two
loving eyes encompassed the girlish figure
before her.</p>

<p>“You know I wouldn’t go, anyway,” Nancy
bravely answered. “I’m going to save my
trip to Europe, until&mdash;until&mdash;later,” she faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
“You shall have it,” declared her mother
firmly, “and only the importance of this trip
to my business&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course I know that, Mums,” and Nancy
forgot the packing long enough to fold two
prompt arms about her mother’s neck. “You’ll
come back so wise with all your foreign cataloging,
that you’ll be made chief of the reference
department. Then I’ll go to college&mdash;maybe;
although I would so much rather go to
art school.”</p>

<p>The young mother smiled indulgently.
“College will not interfere with your art ambitions,
dear,” she explained. “But there’s
time enough to decide all that. What’s worrying
me now, is leaving you for this long,
unknown summer.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” Nancy hurried to add.
“It is unknown. It seems to me everything
happens in summer. Winter is just one
school-day after another, but summer! What
can’t happen in summer?”</p>

<p>Dancing around with a wild pretense of
gaiety, Nancy was dropping this article and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
picking up that, in her efforts to assist with
the European packing; but even the most
uninformed stranger would easily have
guessed that the impending separation was
disquieting, if not actually alarming to her,
as well as to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brandon, Nancy’s mother, was being
sent abroad in the interest of an educational
quest, being carried on by the library which
employed her; and besides Nancy there was
Ted. Ted the small brother, so important
and so loving a member of the little group.
But summer for a boy like Ted merely meant
the selection of the best camp, with the most
trustworthy counsellor and the best established
reputation. That, with his little trunk,
his brown suits and his endless wood’s-tools,
made up Ted’s schedule and outfit, without
a possible flaw in the simple arrangements.</p>

<p>Not that he didn’t sniffle, as Nancy whispered
to Miss Manners, because he did,
every single time he looked at the last picture
he, Nancy, and his mother stood against
the old tree for, while Manny snapped it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
More than that, Nancy had seen him take
Nero, his dog, down to the pond twice in one
day, the day before he left for camp, although
Nero could not have needed two baths, with
soap and a rub down, in one day.</p>

<p>But Ted was gone now, and there remained
but one more night and two hours of the next
day before Mrs. Brandon also should be gone.</p>

<p>The thought was appalling. Gone for two
whole months while Nancy would be visiting
her rich but unknown cousin Rosalind.</p>

<p>The day before any important event is usually
a time of anxiety or of joyous expectation,
for the joy, or even the fear of anticipation, is
a well known preliminary condition. So it
was this which Nancy and her mother were
experiencing.</p>

<p>The daughter was by no means an unusual
girl, for all girls are remarkable in their own
peculiar way. Nancy was dark, her eyes
having the same tint as her hair&mdash;when one
regarded their mere color, but looking into
them or having Nancy throw out their full
powers upon another, gave the quiet little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
pools such glints and flashes, that their color
scheme became quite secondary in actual
valuation. Laughter seemed to wait in one
corner while concern was hidden just opposite,
for Nancy Brandon was a girl of many moods,
original to the point of recklessness, defiant
of detail where that might interfere with some
new and novel idea, but always sincere.</p>

<p>It was this last saving quality that endeared
Nancy to her many friends, for who
can resist a perfectly honest girl, unselfish,
and unspoiled? Her prettiness was a matter
of peculiar complement, for being tall she was
correspondingly thin and supple, being dark
she had a lovely olive skin with little patches
of rose color, and her hair&mdash;well, her hair had
been long, curly, and her mother’s pride, but
Nancy was now determined to have it bobbed&mdash;some
day soon!</p>

<p>“It is not only old fashioned,” she had
argued with her mother, “but barbaric.
American girls are not going to be ape-ish any
longer. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>To which the mother had listened reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and had given Nancy permission to get
her hair cut if she chose&mdash;after she reached
the summer home of her cousin Rosalind.
This qualification of the much argued plan
was so fixed because Rosalind had wonderful
hair and, said Mrs. Brandon, Nancy might
not like to be without any, or much, in contrast.</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be queer in the big house,”
Nancy interposed without need of elucidation.
“Big houses always are queer and&mdash;spooky.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brandon laughed lightly at that.
“I’m glad you’re not timid, Nance,” she said,
“for the old place must seem rather uncanny
by this time. But it was beautiful, very beautiful
when your Aunt Katherine lived. Of
course, Aunt Betty is so much younger&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a step-wife to Uncle Fred,” jerked
Nancy. “I always think that step-wives are
up-ish and put on a lot of airs. I’m sure
Rosalind thinks so too.”</p>

<p>“You mean second wife to Uncle Fred and
stepmother to Rosalind,” corrected Mrs.
Brandon. “Rosa is just about the age to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
rebellious&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And she’s so&mdash;awfully fat.”</p>

<p>All this was merely the going over of well
known details, concerning the big house and
its occupants, forming the background of
Nancy’s prospective summer. For she was
to visit Rosalind Fernell at Fernlode, in the
New Hampshire mountains, and Rosalind was
best known as being “awfully fat.” True, she
was also step-daughter to Mrs. Frederic
Fernell, the lovely little and very young wife
of Mr. Fernell of the famous woolen mill company.
But to Nancy, Rosalind seemed unfortunate
because of both these conditions;
being fat and being a step-daughter were inescapable
hardships, thought she.</p>

<p>Letter after letter had poured out Rosalind’s
miseries, in fact it was because her
troubles were presented by the cousin as being
really acute, that Mrs. Brandon hesitated
long before deciding to let Nancy visit her.
But the big hearted Uncle Frederic, in his
letters pointed out what appeared to be the
real truth of the situation, namely: that Rosalind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
was rather spoiled from being alone so
much, and, of course, Betty, his young wife,
couldn’t possibly make a companion of a little
spoiled child, so&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m sure to love Rosalind,” Nancy again
reflected, “because she seems so frank and
honest. Being fat isn’t a crime. She can’t
help that.” This decision, merely a repetition
of her usual conclusion, was being reached
as a sequel to Uncle Frederic’s last letter.</p>

<p>“Mother,” Nancy began, bravely attempting
to banish the loneliness that even now
seemed to foreshadow herself and her charming
young mother, “do tell me once more, just
<em>once</em> more, about Orilla. Is she Rosalind’s
cousin?”</p>

<p>“No. Orilla is really the daughter of a
nurse who was with Uncle Fred’s first wife,
your Aunt Katherine, during her long illness.
Orilla lived at Fernlode, and naturally felt it
should always be her home. In fact, she even
felt that she should have been the proverbial
Cinderella, but there was no such idea in the
minds of Uncle Fred or Aunt Katherine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Mrs. Rigney, Orilla’s mother, had been very
generously paid for her services, and Orilla’s
education was also provided for; but the girl
seems to hold a bitter grudge against your new
Aunt Betty&mdash;quite as if uncle Fred’s marriage
to her had cut off Orilla’s hopes, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” murmured Nancy. “I can understand
that. But I don’t see why Rosa
bothers with her.”</p>

<p>“She is, I believe, a rather persistent young
lady and it is she who bothers Rosa. However,
dear, don’t you worry about that angle of
Uncle Fred’s affairs. Just make up your
mind to have a wonderful time and so soothe
my conscience for leaving you.”</p>

<p>Followed moments, minutes, little hours of
tender endearments. The mother cautioning,
telling, advising, reminding Nancy of so
many and such various possibilities; the
daughter questioning&mdash;just that, and only
with the loving look from the soft, dark eyes,
the appeal from her trembling lips, the protection
begged by her eager young arms; for
Nancy was now quite conscious of the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
that her mother, the great, the wonderful
fortress against every possible and every impossible
evil, was about to be withdrawn from
her life for a time. But time didn’t seem to
matter. Two months or two years; it was just
the fact, the unavoidable disaster that confronted
her.</p>

<p>“Your hat box holds as much as a suitcase,”
said Nancy, laying very tenderly into the
round, black box, one more pair of nice, white
silk stockings, Nancy’s extra gift. “Be sure
to wear your black and white felt on the
steamer, Mums. You look stunning in that
hat.”</p>

<p>“All right, sweet-heart, I’ll remember,”
promised the mother, who herself was busy
with Nancy’s things. “I’m glad your trunk
goes today. Somehow it is easier to attend
to mine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Hum-m-m-hum. You want <em>me</em>
out of the way first. But, really, I think it
cheating not to let me see you off,” grumbled
Nancy in pretty pretense.</p>

<p>“Now, you know, dear&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
“’Course I do. I’m just teasing you,
Mumsey. I wouldn’t really want to get
mixed up with your party. They might
sweep me away and put goggles on me, to
match me up with the library high-brow
folks. When a girl’s mother is made a librarian
delegate, I suppose,” sighed Nancy affectedly,
“she ought to wear goggles anyway.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go making fun of my&mdash;peers,” cautioned
Mrs. Brandon in the same bantering
manner. “I tell you, my dear, if it were not
for the library we wouldn’t any of us be taking
a vacation. There’s the postman now. And
I can see Ted’s postcard coming!”</p>

<p>“Four of them!” shouted Nancy, who had
already made hold the bright pictured messages.
“Why four, all at once?”</p>

<p>“Laid over,” laconically answered the postman.
“Those camps let their mail pile up,
I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>But Nancy was deciphering the boy’s
scrawl which, when classed as handwriting,
was never model, but now, classed as his first
message home from his first week at camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
amounted to perfectly ideal “broad-casting.”</p>

<p>They read and re-read, Nancy finding little
secret words sticking on the canoe sails and
peeping out of, what might have been a cloudburst,
if the postcard had not carried with it
the other explanation. This read “Beautiful
Lake Tuketo by Moonlight” and it was the
moonlight effect that was so apt to be misleading.</p>

<p>“He’s all right, at any rate,” remarked the
mother, thus betraying her anxieties. “And
he seems to be having a good time,” she sighed
relievedly.</p>

<p>“Trust Ted for that,” Nancy reminded her.
“But what an awful looking lot of boys! Just
see my card! They look like a comedy parade.”</p>

<p>“Why Nancy! They’re fine looking little
chaps, I’m sure,” defended Mrs. Brandon.
“But I suppose that picture was taken to show
the raising of Old Glory, not as a beauty contest
illustration.”</p>

<p>“’S’cuse me,” murmured Nancy. “Of

but I wouldn’t swap our Ted for&mdash;the whole
bunch!”</p>

<p>“Nancy&mdash;Brandon!!”</p>

<p>“Yes-sum!” confessed Nancy, glorifying in
her pretended ungrammatic freedom.</p>

<span>AN INCIDENTAL EXPLOSION</span></h2>


<p>Even the most difficult tasks are finally
accomplished, and now Nancy was actually
riding towards Boston. The details of closing
up their little home had been rather confusing,
especially as each member of the small family
was starting out in a different direction, but
it was all done at last, and soon Nancy would
cross Boston and take the Maine line out
toward New Hampshire.</p>

<p>It seemed so unnecessary for any one to
meet her at the South Station and taxi with
her over to the North Station, but there was
Miss Newton, a friend who had visited the
Brandons and who lived almost in Boston.
With her, Nancy’s mother had arranged, both
for crossing the big city and having lunch, so
that there could be no possible danger in her
daughter’s journey. Also, after lunch in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
upstairs station restaurant, Miss Newton, a
lively young woman who seemed just like a
girl to Nancy, insisted upon making up a little
box of fruit for the train journey.</p>

<p>“Never can tell about these long afternoon
rides,” said Miss Newton, when she bought
five more blue plums. “They may side-track
you and you’ll be glad to have a fruity supper
along with you.”</p>

<p>Nancy expressed her gratitude, of course,
and as the Boston and Maine afternoon train
steamed out, she didn’t feel quite so lonely
without her mother, because of Miss Newton’s
jolly waving and pleasant little send-off.</p>

<p>The train was crowded. Many mothers
and children seemed to have been on shopping
tours. Naturally Nancy was concerned with
the prospect before her, for since Rosalind’s
letters were so effusively pre-welcoming and
so hysterically anxious about what she termed,
“the troubles and trials at Fernlode,” Nancy
could form no opinion of the strange household.
She knew she was going to be shy of
that important new, stylish, beautiful Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Betty, for the reputation she had obtained
was enough to strike awe into the heart of any
girl visitor. Of Uncle Frederic she knew positively
that she just loved him, for he had
visited her own home late last fall, and he was
“a king” as Ted expressed it. Rosalind had
been away at boarding school all the time, it
seemed to Nancy, so the young cousins had
never met, for even Rosalind’s vacations had
been usually spent abroad. This year, however,
she had insisted upon remaining at home,
although her father and step-mother were to
sail shortly.</p>

<p>But now Nancy’s train sped on, and the
flying landscape, though novel after the big
factories and the bridges were passed, held
small interest for the young summer tourist.
She noticed that a woman with two small boys
had bought those silly little boxes of ice-cream
with the foolish tin spoons, and their
delight in lapping up the stuff was rather
amusing. It was funny, too, to see the people
spill water cups along the aisle, and when a
very stout man dozed off, and let his bald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
head tap a lady on her bead-bedecked shoulder,
Nancy indulged in an audible titter while
the ice-cream boys shouted loud enough to
wake up the indecorous gentleman.</p>

<p>Such trifling incidents helped to while away
the time, and after the big mill dam was
passed, which according to the timetable indicated
the state line of Massachusetts and New
Hampshire, with somehow touching on a
corner of Maine, then Nancy knew the journey
was almost over.</p>

<p>The afternoon was cool and pleasant, for
early June was still behaving beautifully, and
Nancy was not sorry that she had taken her
mother’s advice and worn her school suit of
blue serge.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she ruminated, “Rosalind’s
clothes will be gor-gee-ous.” This visioned
her own limited outfit. “But being so fat it
must be hard getting clothes. They all have
to be made to order, of course.”</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the little old-fashioned
woman, in the seat opposite Nancy,
spread her ginghamed self out in the aisle, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
order to cope more freely with the over-crowded
bag she was struggling to close. Her
efforts were so violent, and her groans so
audible, that everybody around took frank
notice of her. First, she would get between
the two seats, backing to that in front, and
trudge away at the helpless, hopeless carry-all.
Then, she would put the bag on the floor and
work from the aisle. Finally, she literally
threw up her hands and looked comically at
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it the mischief, sissy?” she said suddenly.
“I got to get off with that bag bulged
wide open.”</p>

<p>Nancy laughed outright. “Sissy” was such
an old-fashioned name to be called. Then she
looked critically at the recalcitrant bag.</p>

<p>“Maybe I could do it,” she suggested, although
she instinctively felt like calling the
car man to help. Yet the funny little country
woman, with her checked gingham dress, her
bronzed skin and her perfectly useless hat,
that merely rested on the top of her frowsy
head, was smiling so friendly, that Nancy felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
impelled to offer personal aid.</p>

<p>So she stepped over and tackled the bag.
It was too full, much too full, of course, and
the articles in it were the non-crushable kind,
hard and firm. Surely the biggest opponent
to the catch and its clasp meeting was a bottle,
for it bulged out in one place as fast as Nancy
tried to push it in at another.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t close it,” Nancy admitted
reluctantly. “Couldn’t you take anything
out?”</p>

<p>The woman pulled her face into such funny
crinkles, it looked as if she was winking all
over it. Then she made queer noises, but
they could not be called words, and at last a
man who had been watching the performance,
over his reading glasses, dropped his paper
and silently offered his services.</p>

<p>He was a very dignified gentleman, and he
readily acknowledged Nancy’s presence, although
he did not directly address her. The
little woman was being regarded as very much
out of order, and truth to tell she was very
generally disturbing the peace in that end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the car.</p>

<p>But now the man, with his strong hands and
white shirt-cuffs, undertook to conquer the
rebel bag. He would plainly have no nonsense,
would make short work of it, for his
face was set with a look of active determination.</p>

<p>Once, twice, he tried to snap it shut. Then&mdash;there
was something like an explosion!</p>

<p>Splash! A perfect fountain of red liquid
shot straight up in the air!</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” yelled the owner of the bag.
“There goes Martha’s grape juice!”</p>

<p>And go it did, apparently as far and farther
than even good home-made grape juice is supposed
to travel, for it covered the face and
shirt front of the determined man, it all but
shampooed the blonde head in the next seat
front, it managed, somehow, to include Nancy
in its area, for across the aisle shot a thin but
virulent little stream, and while one party
was trying to dodge it another would fall into
its furious path.</p>

<p>“A bomb! A bomb!” yelled one of the ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
cream boys joyfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a bandit’s hold-up,” yelped the
other boy, hopefully.</p>

<p>“It’s my lovely grape juice and it’s working&mdash;”
moaned the woman in the gingham
dress. But what she meant by “working”
was not what the spectators were thinking of.
She meant effervescing, while they simply saw
liquid fireworks shooting around the car.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few moments, but the
well intentioned man could not erase the
stains from his expansive shirt front&mdash;it was
hard enough to get the grape juice out of his
eyes.</p>

<p>The blonde woman, whose bobbed head
had been caught in the shower, seemed the
one most injured, and she took no trouble to
restrain her indignation!</p>

<p>“The idea! Carrying that stuff around!”
she argued. “Just imagine! Black and blue
grape juice,” and she swabbed her head frantically
with all the handkerchiefs she could
resurrect from pockets and hand bags. Blonde
hair dyed wine color did look odd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
“I’m awfully sorry,” the gingham woman
admitted. “It was just a present from my
cousin Martha&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then, why didn’t you hire a truck instead
of buying a railway ticket,” fired back the
crimson-spotted blonde. “Seems to me&mdash;”
But her further arguments were lost in the
sudden stopping of the train and the hurried
getting off of the unfortunate grape juice
owner.</p>

<p>She made opportunity for a smile to Nancy,
however, as she edged her way out, and as she
left the train it was the boy who had shouted
“bomb” at the accident who pegged her the
cork of that bottle. Strange to say, the
woman caught the stopper, and bravely took
the almost empty bottle from the rebellious
bag, banged the cork in firmly, and was then
on her way&mdash;with the bottle in one hand and
the famous bag in the other.</p>

<p>Everyone’s face seemed to betray amusement,
for during the entire episode the little
woman had shown real good nature. First,
she was patient, as well as determined, in attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to close the obstreperous bag; next,
when the mighty all-knowing man went to her
assistance and caused the grape juice explosion,
she only smiled and herself took the
blame for his mistake.</p>

<p>All of this wavered in Nancy’s mind, and
with it came one of those unaccountable little
flickering thoughts, unbidden and unreasonable.
It suggested a future meeting of Nancy
and the gingham woman.</p>

<p>“But wherever would I and why ever
should I meet her again?” Nancy deliberated.
“She’s probably just some farmer lady, and
this station is miles from Craggy Bluff.”</p>

<p>The incident served admirably to brighten
the last hour of her journey, and even the
wonderful capers of a late afternoon sun,
gyrating over the New England hills, failed
to hold interest now, as a long train trip
wound up the miles, like a boy’s fish line after
a long waiting and a poor catch.</p>

<p>Nancy’s bag and hat box were made hold
of even before the trainman called out the
station, and now that she had actually arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
at Rosalind’s summer place, Nancy
caught her breath, apprehensively.</p>

<p>“With mother in Europe and Manny far
off, I’ll have to like it,” she reflected, “but
then, why shouldn’t I?” Her question poised
itself boldly before her, for somehow even the
lure of luxury was not altogether reassuring.</p>

<p>It was now almost seven o’clock, and the
young tourist noticed no one preparing to
leave the train at the approaching station.
True, there were so few passengers left, there
might be individual stations for each one of
them; but Craggy Bluff was sure to be exclusive.</p>

<p>The very word as she thought of it, rather
terrified Nancy, for, after all, she enjoyed folks,
loved companionship and appreciated girlhood’s
privileges.</p>

<p>“But Rosalind and&mdash;Orilla,” she was forced
to reflect, “they will be good company&mdash;I
hope.” It was Orilla’s personality that puzzled
her, for the accounts of that queer girl
had been anything but flattering.</p>

<p>“Craggy Bluff!” called out the trainman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
who promptly approached Nancy and took
up her bag. This had been arranged for by
the thoughtful Miss Newton, when the train
was leaving Boston, so that there was no
danger of Nancy mistaking her destination, or
being inconvenienced by her baggage.</p>

<p>She stepped from the train, thanked the
trainman and took her bag, just as a smiling
girl ran up to her.</p>

<p>It was Rosalind! Fat and rosy, jolly and
rollicking.</p>

<p>“Nancy!” she cried happily.</p>

<p>“Rosalind!” responded the traveller.</p>

<p>“Oh, how ducky! I just couldn’t wait.
Over here. Chet!” called Rosalind to the
chauffeur, who promptly hurried along for the
bags. Rosalind continued to puff and putter.
“Nancy! Isn’t it too darling to have you
come?” Her arm was wound around Nancy’s
waist. “Do you like the woods? And the
water? And the hills? We even have wild
beasts out here, but I never have hunted
alone. Here’s our car. Jump right in. Chet,
I must call at the post office.” Thus rattled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
on the exuberant Rosalind, as Nancy formed
her first pleasant opinion of the important
cousin.</p>

<p>Following these preliminaries, Nancy did
manage to say a few words. But they didn’t
mean anything, much, other than being pleasant
words happily spoken.</p>

<p>The cousins were at last becoming acquainted,
and while Nancy knew she was sure
to love the impulsive Rosalind, Rosalind felt
she was simply “dead in love” with Nancy,
all of which favored the hopeful summertime
ahead.</p>

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span>COUSIN AND COZ</span></h2>


<p>Winding in and out of wooded drives and
tree tunneled roads, as they went from the
station, Nancy sensed something of the luxury
she had so wondered about.</p>

<p>Yes, it was wonderful to cover distance
that way, and the distance itself was wonderful,
because Craggy Bluff was one of those
works of Nature varied in detail from the
finest ferns to the shaggiest giant oaks, and
the very craggiest gray granite rocks to the
daintiest pearl pebbles that studded the silvery
beach.</p>

<p>“Oh, such glorious trees!” Nancy would
exclaim as the car tore holes in the sunset’s
shadows.</p>

<p>“Trees! If you like trees, Nance, just wait
until daylight, and I show you huge black
forests,” declared Rosalind, kindling merrily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to Nancy’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“And when Uncle Frederic and Aunt&mdash;his
wife,” Nancy corrected herself, “go away,
will you be here all alone?”</p>

<p>“All alone! I wish I could be,” replied
Rosalind, “then we could have sport; just you
and I and, of course, a few servants. But,
Nance, I never can get away from Margot,
my old nurse, you know. Darling mother,
my own mother, trusted her always, because
she herself had been ill so long, so, of course,
Margot’s sort of bossy yet. She’s as good as
gold, but one doesn’t want gold bands around
one’s neck all the time,” laughed Rosalind, as
the car drew up to the broad veranda.</p>

<p>Even in the dusk, for it was now quite dark
under the heavy foliage, Nancy could easily
discern the massive outline of the big country
house. She knew its story; how her Uncle
Frederic had bought it from some old New
England family just because it offered a seeming
refuge for the first Mrs. Fernell, Rosalind’s
mother, whose early invalidism had ended in
leaving the girl so much alone among servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and wealth. Aunt Katherine had loved the
big house which she had called Fernlode, because
the ferns grew in paths and veins almost
unbroken in their lines, and also because Fern
was a part of their old family name.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Margot!” called out Rosalind,
as a big woman came up smiling to that
call.</p>

<p>She greeted Nancy happily, and at once the
visitor understood why she was considered
bossy, for she directed the man to take the
bags and to do several other things all at the
same time.</p>

<p>“Rosalind dear, you should have worn a
sweater. See how cool it is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A blessing, Margot dear. Haven’t we
been roasting for days? Sweater! I just
want to feel comfortable for a little while.
Come on, Nance, I always run upstairs.
Helps me reduce&mdash;”</p>

<p>And the puffing Rosalind executed a series
of jumps, in lieu of running, which seemed
too much to expect of her, and this bore out
the fat girl’s good intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
“I do every earthly thing I can, you know,”
confessed Rosalind, as they stood before an
open door, “but I can’t see that it does one
bit of good. I’m&mdash;hoping&mdash;you may have&mdash;a
secret&mdash;recipe&mdash;” Breath giving out, Rosalind
gave in, and sank down on a big chintz
covered chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you worry about being
fat, Rosa,” said Nancy with real sincerity.
“Here I’m too thin and mother keeps worrying
about that all the time&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, what an idea!” chuckled Rosalind.
“We can be the Before and After sign&mdash;fat
and thin, you know. Wouldn’t that be great?”
and as she laughed Nancy remembered another
familiar sign. It was to do with laughing
and growing fat!</p>

<p>“Shall I change for dinner?” Nancy asked
when the gale of mirth subsided and Rosalind
stood before a mirror patting her turbulent
hair.</p>

<p>“No-o-o!” drawled Rosa. “Just put a ribbon
around your head and that’ll be all you
need to do. Dad won’t be home tonight&mdash;he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in Boston, and Betty” (she whispered
this) “is never home when Dad’s away. So a
ribbon will fool Margot, and after dinner&mdash;”
A queerly pulled face, that made a pincushion
out of Rosa’s features, finished the sentence.
Evidently she had some important plans for
after dinner.</p>

<p>As they “fussed up” Nancy noticed how
really pretty Rosalind was. Her eyes were
always laughing and they were blue, her
mouth was always smiling and it was scalloped,
and her hair was “gorgeous,” being a
perfect mop of brown curls rather short but
not bobbed. It was this head of hair that
from baby hood had distinguished Rosalind,
for her “lovely curls” were a matter of family
pride to all but herself.</p>

<p>Her weight, however, could not be denied,
even by one so favorably prejudiced as Nancy,
for Rosalind Fernell was decidedly fat, as has
been said before. She wore just now a one-piece
dress of very brightly colored summer
goods, with the figures so mixed up that
Nancy remembered her brother Ted’s calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
this style “circus clothes.”</p>

<p>Nancy, disregarding Rosalind’s suggestion
for a ribbon around her head to make up a
dinner costume, had managed to slip into the
simple white voile that her mother was so
solicitous about having exactly on top of her
bag, so that she could slip into it quickly,
and this with the yellow ribbon band around
her dark hair completed, rather than composed,
the costume.</p>

<p>“You look perfectly duckie,” declared Rosalind,
giving her cousin a frankly admiring
glance. “And I’m glad you did dress up, for
maybe Gar will be over.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Gar?” asked Nancy.</p>

<p>“He’s my&mdash;lifeguard; I’d perish without
Garfield Durand. He lives on the next pile
of rocks and he’s more fun than a troop.
You’ll love Gar, I’m sure. There’s Baldy
calling dinner. Baldy is the butler, you
know, and he’s the most perfect baldy you
ever gazed at. Has a head like the crystal
ball in the back yard.”</p>

<p>For a camp, which was really what this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
summer home was supposed to be, Nancy
thought everything about her most elaborate.
The house was as heavily built as any city
house might be, and the big beamed ceiling
in the long dining room, made her think of an
old English picture. The butler, Thomas,
called Baldy, by the irrepressible Rosalind,
rather awed Nancy at first, but, unlike the
butlers in fiction, he could smile, and he could
bend and he was human, so that after her
chair had been adjusted and her water poured,
Nancy presently felt quite at ease and enjoyed,
rather than feared, her surroundings.
Margot sat at Rosalind’s side and Nancy was
placed opposite. After all, she thought, one’s
simple meals at home were no different from
that being served, except that at home things
came more promptly and&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps they
did taste a little better mother’s way. However,
the soup was good and the chicken easy
to eat, while the dessert was piled high with
cream and Nancy ate it&mdash;to make her fat.</p>

<p>“Rosalind, you had better have&mdash;” Margot
was objecting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
“Nop-ee, I’m going to have <em>this</em>,” interrupted
Rosalind, who took the overly rich
dessert in defiance of ounces more of the much
detested fat, which were bound to follow.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fred phoned that she was detained
in the city and so could not be here to greet
you, Nancy,” Margot said, as Thomas pulled
out her chair, “but I’m sure Rosalind wants
you all to herself, so Mrs. Fred need not be
anxious.” This little pleasantry was followed
up by an effusive reply from Rosalind, who
couldn’t really seem to get close enough to
Nancy for her own affectionate satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right, Margot,” she assured
the tall woman with the unavoidable
horn-rimmed glasses. “We’ve got oodles of
things to talk about, and piles of things to do.
You won’t mind if I let up on the exercise to-night,
will you?”</p>

<p>“But you know, Rosie&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Course I do, Margy,” and Rosalind
coaxed prettily. “But I want to entertain
Cousin Nancy&mdash;”</p>

<p>The smiling assent from Margot seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
unnecessary, for Rosalind was trooping off,
with her arm around Nancy’s waist, and her
laughter bubbling like the soap-suds Ted
loved to blow out of his old corn-cob pipe.</p>

<p>Nancy couldn’t help thinking of her brother
Ted, the boy now far away at camp, for, somehow,
she was missing him in spite of all this
strange adventure. He was always such a
jolly little fellow. What a lark he would have
had in this big place and how he would contrive
to turn every little incident into a laugh
or a chuckle? While Rosalind was speaking
to the butler, and while she gave some message
to Margot, Nancy had just a little time for
ruminating. She wondered what her mother
was doing. And how the long summer ahead
would turn out for each of her small, intimate
family.</p>

<p>“Come into my room,” said Rosalind at her
elbow, as they once again had mounted the
broad stairs. “It’s right next to yours&mdash;I
thought you might be scary if I put you over
in the guest room,” said the cousin, considerately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“I should much rather be near you, thanks
Rosa,” replied Nancy, meaning exactly what
she said, for with real night settling down upon
the mountains, a queer loneliness amounting
almost to foreboding seemed to seize upon her.</p>

<p>“And you are never lonely out here?” she
could not resist remarking, for it seemed to her
Rosalind’s spirits were mounting higher each
moment. She laughed at the slightest excuse,
and appeared to Nancy somewhat over excited.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, sometimes I have been.
But not since Gar came. He was abroad last
summer, but now&mdash;why, he drives me every
place when Margot and Chet think I’m&mdash;doing
something else.”</p>

<p>This last piece of information was almost
whispered to Nancy, and it was not difficult
for her to guess that Rosalind indulged in
pranks as well as in bubbling laughter.</p>

<p>“But you don’t really go out without your
daddy’s knowing?” Nancy timidly asked.</p>

<p>“Bless the infant!” cooed Rosalind, “I do
believe she’s a regular little darling, country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
coz,” and another demonstration accompanied
that. “But I won’t shock you to death. I’m
really quite harmless, and you see,” her face
sobered for a moment, “all that I do concerns
myself. I think I should have the privilege
of enjoying myself, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course. That is&mdash;” Already
Nancy found herself perplexed. What
if Rosalind was as risky as she pretended to
be; and if she, Nancy, would find it difficult
to keep free from responsibility?</p>

<p>“You know Orilla, she’s the girl who used to
live here, is too smart for words,” imparted
Rosalind, as the two girls delayed in Rosalind’s
beautiful golden room. “She believes
she can help me to&mdash;to get thin” (there was
wistfulness in this remark), “but Betty just
can’t bear her. So, of course, I have to do
lots of things on the sly.”</p>

<p>Instantly there flashed before Nancy’s mind
the suggestion her mother had made concerning
this girl, Orilla. And a suspicious,
jealous girl is not less dangerous just because
she happens to be young. In fact, thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Nancy, that would only make her less wise
and more foolish.</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span>FROM THE NEXT PILE OF ROCKS</span></h2>


<p>Grave misgivings flooded into Nancy’s
mind. She had known of Rosalind’s peculiarities,
had often heard her mother express
keen regret that she, Uncle Frederic’s own
sister, could not have done something to supply
the mother-need for Rosalind when Katherine
Fernell was taken from her daughter.</p>

<p>And it seemed more unfortunate than otherwise,
that Uncle Fred’s position guaranteed so
much hired care for Rosalind, because it was
this fact that had separated her from Mrs.
Brandon, Nancy’s mother herself having
been separated from her brother through a
circumstance not unlike this very issue.</p>

<p>Not that Nancy bothered now to recall all
this, but just because the “why” of her own
circumstances compared oddly with the “why
not” of Rosalind’s. It appeared that Rosalind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
did not know why she should not “sneak
off to ride with Gar” when she was supposed
to be following all the rules of Fernlode, which
must have forbidden this.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is not that I’m any better
than Rosa,” the puzzled Nancy was thinking,
“but just because mother made me think
differently.”</p>

<p>“Nance, I suppose you are tired from that
long, dirty train ride,” suggested Rosalind,
who was getting out a wrap for herself and
another for Nancy. “Suppose we just scout
around a little?”</p>

<p>“Scout around?”</p>

<p>“Yeppy. First let’s make sure you’re acquainted
with your room, because you might
want to come in before I do,” said Rosalind.
“Here’s all the night stuff, but I don’t suppose
you try to bathe and scour off fat as I do. At
any rate, do just as you please. Lock your
door and yell through the keyhole at Margot,
and if she asks for me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Won’t you be&mdash;in?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” Rosalind hurried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
assure the puzzled girl. “I’m just preparing
for emergencies. You see, I always expect
them, but they somehow seldom come.” A
little sigh took years from Rosalind’s heavy
shoulders. She was acting now like such a
very little girl, just sighing for romance and
adventure.</p>

<p>On the big front porch, they tried the swing.
As ever Rosalind cuddled up to Nancy in that
eager, impulsive way that made Nancy feel
sort of old. She, not being demonstrative
herself, leaving that prerogative for the small
brother Ted, could not at once get used to
Rosalind’s effusions.</p>

<p>“You see, Nance,” bubbled Rosalind, “I’m
going to do something won-der-ful!” This
last word was dragged out like a tape line
measuring thrills. “I waited until you came&mdash;you
see, Orilla is really won-der-ful. She’s
the very smartest thing. And you see, Nancy,
<em>you</em> can’t realize the curse of being fat.”</p>

<p>A peal of laughter from the amused Nancy
checked this.</p>

<p>“You can’t really mean it, Rosa,” she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
“Being fat isn’t anything. You’re just growing,
and you won’t always be so&mdash;so stout,”
the visitor assured her cousin, kindly.</p>

<p>“No, you just bet I won’t, not if I know it,”
declared Rosa, who even then chewed a chocolate
drop. “I’m going to get thin while the
folks are in Europe. Wait until you see
Betty, then you’ll understand. She’s just
eel-ly, and she loves slippery clothes, the
shimmery-shimmery kind. How could she
ever own me as a step-daughter?” Again the
catchy little sigh betrayed Rosa’s state of
mind. Nancy was beginning to wonder if she
might not be a little bit jealous of the famously
beautiful Betty.</p>

<p>“But don’t you know,” cautioned Nancy,
feeling more and more like a grandmother
giving advice, “it’s awfully dangerous to&mdash;to
take off fat too suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe a word of it,” declared Rosa.
“I’d take a chance on reducing pounds per day
if I knew how. You see,” shifting the cushion
and kicking the swing into action, “I inherit
it from Grandmother Cashion, mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
mother. She was fat. I have her picture.
And she had curly hair like mine, so of course
I just had to be like her,” argued the surprising
girl.</p>

<p>“But you also got the curls,” suggested
Nancy, in genuine admiration.</p>

<p>“Which I don’t want. Orilla says they
make me look fatter, more babyish, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Orilla has thin hair,” Nancy
could not resist saying, for she was already
convinced of Orilla’s methods.</p>

<p>“’Tis straightish, rather straggily,” conceded
Rosa. “But, you see, Orilla doesn’t
have to be pretty, she’s so smart.”</p>

<p>“What is she so smart about?” pressed
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, ’most everything,” floundered
Rosa. “She intends to be a nurse, no, a
beauty doctor,” she corrected herself. “That’s
why she’s helping me.”</p>

<p>“How’s she doing it?” demanded Nancy,
frankly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s sort of a secret, but, of course, I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
tell you later on,” agreed Rosa.</p>

<p>“Does your&mdash;does Betty know?”</p>

<p>“Mercy me, no! She’s the very last person
on earth to know,” said Rosa tragically. “I’m
going to surprise her, and dad. It’s all beautifully
planned and I’m just waiting for them
to sail, then I’ll sail in.”</p>

<p>“You’re an awful lot like our Ted,” Nancy
told Rosa, a compliment unqualified.</p>

<p>“Is he fat?”</p>

<p>“A little. But I don’t mean that way. I
mean in making plans. He always has the
most wonderful ideas&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’d love Ted. What a shame you didn’t
bring him along.”</p>

<p>“He would have been jolly,” agreed the
sister wistfully. “But you see, Ted needs to
be trained. Being a boy without a father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just like me being a girl without a mother,”
spoke up Rosa. “I’d <em>love</em> to go to camp. In
fact, father almost agreed, but Betty! You
see Betty believes in white hands and slim
ankles.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“Want to go around to the other side of the
house? We can watch the boats from there.
We have a motorboat but that’s one thing
dad is strict about. He just won’t let me go
on the water at night without him&mdash;imagine
his having to be along always. And he won’t
let me go in a canoe even in broad daylight,
unless I almost swear I’ll stay in the cove, or
just hug the edge. Dad is such a darling, I
never would think of breaking my word to
him,” declared Rosa, her hand bruising Nancy’s
arm in making the declaration.</p>

<p>“We do feel that way when we love folks,
don’t we?” supplied Nancy. “Mother hardly
asks me to promise anything, except where
something might be dangerous, but it’s fun to
keep a promise as well as to break it, if you
just think that way. I’ve a chum who spends
most of her time planning to fool folks. Maybe
I’m old fashioned, but I’ve tried it and it
didn’t turn out so funny. Once when I tried
to fool Ted by locking him out, he just climbed
in a window I couldn’t reach, and I came
pretty near having to stay out in the rain all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
night. You see, Miss Manners, we call her
Manny&mdash;is to us about like Margot is to you.
Except, of course, she isn’t a servant, she’s a
dear friend we found last year out at Long
Leigh. We had a great time last summer,”
Nancy continued. “I’ll have to tell you about
it some time.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to hear. You had a shop or something,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a funny little store we turned into
almost everything but a church,” laughed
Nancy. They were moving around the winding
porch and Nancy felt relieved that Rosa
seemed to be more contented than she had
been at dinner time. Surely she wasn’t
thinking of stealing off any place?</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the lake look lovely with all the
boats lighted up?” Rosa exclaimed. “With
the big black mountains at the back and the
little firefly boats in front&mdash;I guess this is one
of the most beautiful lakes in America,” she
finished.</p>

<p>“It is glorious,” agreed Nancy. “But it
makes me feel sort of awe-stricken,” she admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
“Not homesick? That isn’t just a nice way
of saying you’re homesick, Nance?” asked
Rosa solicitously.</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed, Rosa,” denied Nancy.
“But I was just thinking how dark it can be
under all these trees.”</p>

<p>“And this house hasn’t a bright spot in it,”
added Rosa. “I wonder why folks build with
black beams in forests? And they always
seem to. If I were planning a mountain camp
I’d have white pine wood and turn yellow
paint on with a hose, inside and out,” she
declared. A car was coming up the winding
drive, its headlights threading their way
through the trees in glaring billows.</p>

<p>“There’s Gar!” exclaimed Rosa, joy juggling
the words. “I’m so glad he came over!
Now, you won’t be homesick.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t,” defended Nancy. But the car
was at the steps now and Rosa was racing off
in that direction. The prospect of meeting a
strange boy fluttered Nancy, naturally, but
Perhaps she would have been more self-conscious
had the caller been a girl. Girls are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
supposed to be critical, and Nancy’s wardrobe
was not elaborate, but boys&mdash;well boys ought
to be jolly. She knew that Ted and his little
friends would still be when they grew up.</p>

<p>“My cousin, you know, Gar,” Rosa was
exclaiming, as the youth in white knickers,
with his prep school sweater of violent yellow,
came along the porch.</p>

<p>The introductions over, Nancy knew she
was going to like Garfield Durand. His manner
toward Rosa was that of a big brother,
and he did not hesitate to argue against many
of her suggestions.</p>

<p>“Can’t take you out, Rosa, unless you’re
sure your dad won’t mind,” he said frankly.
Then turning to Nancy, “Don’t <em>you</em> think it’s
silly to be meeting that Orilla girl&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Gar!” came Rosa’s warning. “Please
don’t tell <em>all</em> my secrets at once. I’m sorry
if I bother you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, now Rose, you know well enough I
don’t mean that,” interrupted Gar. “It’s
just that you’re so&mdash;so easy with Orilla, and
she’s a fox, only you won’t believe it,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the boy, flushing.</p>

<p>An awkward silence followed that remark.
It was very plain that Rosa objected to discussing
Orilla and her ways before Nancy. It
was also quite plain that the boy was trying
to avoid something, perhaps a clandestined
ride which Rosa seemed bent upon. He
didn’t settle himself down as one does who
might expect to stay awhile; in fact, he first
sat upon the porch rail, next straddled a
bench, then flung himself into a rocker and
seemed to find it impossible to obtain any position
suitable to his turbulent mood.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly early enough <em>now</em> to take a
drive,” Suggested Rosa, pointedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, surely,” agreed Gar. “Can’t I take
you and your cousin over to the Point, or some
place?”</p>

<p>“Like a dear,” replied Rosa. “I’ll run and
break the news to Margot. She still believes
in you, Gar,” and then Nancy found herself
chatting to the boy, free from the unpleasant
little discussion and at ease, because he
seemed so frankly boyish and so eager to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
her for the proposed drive.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind my scrapping with Rose,”
he remarked. “She’s such a kid and so easily
influenced. And you see, Mr. Fernell trusts
our folks to sort of keep track of her.”</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s splendid,” agreed
Nancy. “You see I’m sort of a stranger myself,
and I guess Rosalind has been a lot
alone&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re the very thing for her, and maybe
just in time,” he said under his breath, with
an intention by no means clear to Nancy.</p>

<p>“Just in time!” she thought. “Whatever
can that mean?”</p>

<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span>THE FALL IN THE WOODS</span></h2>


<p>“We’ll probably pick up Dell,” suggested
Garfield, referring to his sister who was found
on the “next pile of rocks,” as Rosa had described
the Durand estate. She was older
than her brother, much older than Rosa, and
somehow this fact brought relief to Nancy,
who was fearing things she couldn’t quite
define. It seemed safer, however, to have an
older girl along, and when Dell Durand
jumped into the car and added her part to
the fun of driving through the woods, up and
down hills, in and out of sly curves that often
brought Nancy’s breath up sharply, she talked
to Nancy in the sensible, intelligent way that
she, Nancy, was most accustomed to.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t live up here if it were not for
the fun at the Point,” Dell declared. “It’s
all well enough in the daytime&mdash;plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
sport then for anyone who likes the water,
mountains or&mdash;pet dogs,” she said this sarcastically,
“but if we didn’t have the pavilion
for dancing and the movies and such things,
I’m afraid we would find the evenings&mdash;long!”</p>

<p>“Shall we go over to Bent’s?” called Gar
from the wheel.</p>

<p>“Just as Rosa says,” replied his sister politely.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Nancy may be tired,” replied
Rosa considerately. “I haven’t given her a
minute since she landed, and you know what
that Boston and Maine train does to you.
No&mdash;guess we’ll just peek in at the pavilion.
I’m afraid I couldn’t sleep a wink if I didn’t
get a little something to pep me up,” sighed
Rosa. “That house with Margot and Thomas
can get on&mdash;one’s&mdash;nerves&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nerves!” mocked Gar. “Say, Rosie, when
you get nerves I’ll get&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sense,” supplied Rosa, imitating the boy’s
voice. “Anyhow I have a little of that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quit your squabbling, babes,” ordered
Dell. “Can’t you behave before company?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Just then the pavilion loomed up, with the
paper covered lights and jazzing music, not
the usual, ordinary summer place, but rather
a little spot in the wilderness where, evidently,
the young folks of Craggy Bluff found such
evening entertainment as Dell had so briefly
described.</p>

<p>It was all a little strange to Nancy, who had
never before been thrown in with such grown
up young folks. Even Rosa, although in reality
only a few months older than Nancy,
seemed very grown up and superficial, now
that she was mingling with numbers of friends
who promptly greeted their arrival at the
dance hall.</p>

<p>Gar took himself and his car off, excusing
himself to join other boys who claimed him,
while Rosa insisted upon Nancy dancing.</p>

<p>“Let’s wait a while,” Nancy coaxed, not
wishing to lose herself at once in the gliding
dancers.</p>

<p>“Can’t,” objected Rosa. “I’ve got to
dance. It’s good for me,” she whispered;
and when the two girls did glide off, Nancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
was agreeably surprised at the ease displayed
by her cousin.</p>

<p>“Just like floating,” Rosa explained. “I
Can float all day. And dancing is such a silly
walk, isn’t it? Don’t even have to bend.”</p>

<p>It was not much more than a rhythmic walk,
and as for bending&mdash;surely that was quite out
of question, for that season’s dance was markedly
a glide.</p>

<p>Dell was dancing with some young man,
and Gar was not to be seen about, when Rosa
led Nancy over to a corner of the platform.</p>

<p>“I just thought I saw&mdash;someone I knew
over here,” she said, “Orilla, you know. But
I don’t imagine she would be out here&mdash;she’s
so busy, always.”</p>

<p>Rosa was peering into the dark corners
where some few persons stood watching the
dancers. Somehow Nancy was secretly hoping
that Rosa was mistaken, for while she had
a certain curiosity to see this much talked of
Orilla, she would rather have delayed the experience
until some other time.</p>

<p>“I guess it wasn’t she,” Rosa said finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
still jerking her head from side to side attempting
to find the face she was seeking for. “Yes,”
she exclaimed again, “I do believe I see her.
Glide over this way&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it too dark along the edge?” Nancy
asked. She did not like the idea of getting
so far away from Dell. Besides that, it really
was dark and deserted at that end of the platform.</p>

<p>But Rosa was bent upon following the figure
she either saw or imagined she saw. In fact,
so intent was she, that Nancy’s remark went
by unnoticed.</p>

<p>“Wait here just a minute,” Rosa said suddenly,
dropping Nancy’s arm and dashing off
along the uncertain edge of the circular platform.</p>

<p>Fear seized Nancy! What if Rosa was as
foolish as Garfield had hinted, and what if she
should run off even for a short time on some
silly pretext with the undesirable Orilla? Gar
had said that Nancy had arrived “just in
time.” What could he have meant?</p>

<p>She was watching Rosa’s light dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
felt she would surely have to follow her. No
matter what Rosa had said about Nancy
waiting, she was going to keep as close&mdash;</p>

<p>The flash of Rosa’s dress had gone out like
a candle flame in the wind. Turning her own
steps in the direction Rosa must have taken,
she hurried along the platform’s edge and just
caught a glimmer of something light&mdash;Rosa’s
dress it must have been&mdash;darting through the
trees, away from the pavilion.</p>

<p>“Rosalind!” she called anxiously. “Rosa!”</p>

<p>A queer little twittering whistle, that could
not have been an answer from Rosalind,
pierced the darkness. The music had ceased,
that dance was over and now the young folks
were all flocking in the other direction. Nancy
saw this, too, as she stepped off the platform
and attempted to follow the hidden trail of
Rosalind.</p>

<p>“How absurd!” she could not help sighing,
“if this is the way I’m going to spend my
summer chasing after a foolish girl&mdash;”</p>

<p>The next moment she was sure she heard
whispering. That certainly was Rosa, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
why should she be hiding?</p>

<p>“Rosa!” again called Nancy, this time feeling
very much like turning back to Dell and
leaving Rosa to report for herself.</p>

<p>Indignant and offended, Nancy was almost
about to follow out that thought when a sudden
sharp cry&mdash;it was from Rosa&mdash;certainly&mdash;a
cry of pain came from a spot close by.</p>

<p>“Oh, Orilla! quick!” Nancy heard. “My
foot is caught and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosa, where are you?” sharply demanded
Nancy. “<em>I’m</em> here! I can help you!”</p>

<p>“She’s all right&mdash;” came a voice not Rosa’s.
Then the flash of a small light betrayed the
spot where Rosa had fallen.</p>

<p>“It’s my foot, it got caught in briars, and
oh, mercy!” Rosa exclaimed, “I’m afraid I’ve
sprained my ankle!”</p>

<p>By this time Nancy could see Rosa’s companion.
So that was Orilla! A tall girl with
fiery red hair that even in the glimmering
light of the hand flash which she, Orilla, was
holding, looked too red to be pretty. It was
as if the head that held it all was in a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
blaze, rather than being covered with hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re all right, Rose. Get up,” the
girl ordered so unkindly that Nancy bent
over and put her arm about the struggling
figure.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;beastly!”
poor Rose was muttering. “Just
to jump into a hole and get strangled with
briars&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on to me, dear.” Nancy could not
help offering the endearing term, for the red-haired
girl surely was scoffing. And Rosa’s
every attempt to seem grown up, her foolish
little expressions, and her disregard of that
sort of conduct which Nancy very well knew
was Rosa’s natural manner just being held
back, made the cousin all the more an object
of affection to Nancy. She was now Rosa’s
champion against this girl, Orilla.</p>

<p>“Showing off,” was what it all was, of
course, but there was something more important
to think of just now. Rosa was hurt,
the Durands were not in sight and Nancy was
simply frightened to death at the whole situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
“Can’t you really get up?” asked Orilla,
showing some concern herself now. She was
holding the flash light over Rosa, and in the
darkness its rays shone clear and remarkably
bright for a thing so small. It picked out a
mass of wicked briars and treacherous undergrowth
into which Rosa had fallen.</p>

<p>“I can’t&mdash;stir&mdash;” she moaned. “There’s a
regular rope of something around&mdash;my&mdash;leg.
Oh-h-h!”</p>

<p>It was not hard to realize that a rope of
something had indeed imprisoned the girl, for
even the efforts of Orilla joining those of
Nancy, failed to extricate the injured one.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;shall&mdash;we do!” breathed Nancy,
more deeply concerned than she wished to
admit even to herself. “However will we get
her out of this?”</p>

<p>“Silly thing for her to get into,” grumbled
the red-haired girl. “But I guess I can chop
her out.”</p>

<p>“Chop her out!” exclaimed Nancy, <a name="incredulously" id="incredulously"></a><ins title="Original has 'increduously'">incredulously</ins>.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got tools. You stay here with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
her, and for goodness’ sake keep her quiet.
My car is over on the road. I’ll be back as
quickly as I can get here.”</p>

<p>Presently the two girls found themselves
alone, in the dark, in that lonesome wood.
Nancy was too frightened to do more than
keep whispering courage to Rosa, and Rosa
was too miserable to do more than groan.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;” started Nancy once more, but
checked the query before it was formed. Of
what use to question Rosa now? The thing
to do was to hope for Orilla’s return. But
even that worried Nancy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nance,” groaned Rosa, “if my poor
leg is broken&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, dear, I’m sure,” consoled Nancy.
“You know a strain feels dreadfully at first.
Are you sure she’ll come back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. She sounds mean, but that’s her
way,” Rosa explained. “Can’t you see her
light? Isn’t she coming yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nancy. “And Rosa, I feel
I’ll just have to go back to the pavilion for
Dell. What will they think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
“Think we’re lost, maybe.” Rosa was
tugging at the briars and uttering groans at
every attempt to free herself. Nancy had
torn the skin from her right hand in her attempts
to help, but was still working carefully.</p>

<p>“How far is the road?” Nancy asked presently.</p>

<p>“Just there, behind that little hill. You
can’t see it, of course&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you stay while I look for Dell?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to. But oh, Nance,” as her
cousin prepared to go, “you know I don’t
want them to see me meeting Orilla. They
just wouldn’t understand. Every one hates
her so and she’s so bitter about it. Look
again. Isn’t she coming?”</p>

<p>Mystified, Nancy obeyed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe she is. There’s a spark&mdash;yes,
it’s her light,” she added relievedly. “But
how will she chop you out?”</p>

<p>“She carries tools; she’ll have a little chopper&mdash;a
small ax, you know,” faltered Rosa,
relief showing also in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
“You mean a hatchet. Why would she
carry a hatchet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll tell you, sometime; if I ever get
out of this,” groaned Rosa, digging her fingers
deep into the flesh of Nancy’s arm to which
she was clinging.</p>

<p>The faithful little flash-light dispelled what
darkness it could reach, as the girl with the
small hatchet hurried back to them.</p>

<p>“Now don’t move while I chop,” she ordered
sharply. “I’m hours late now, and I’ve got to
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Being late&mdash;” began Nancy indignantly.
But holding back the briars and bushes while
Orilla chopped at that which so securely bound
Rosa, precluded anything like objections to
the apparent heartlessness of Orilla.</p>

<p>“There; I guess you can get up now. Hope
to goodness I’m not all stung with poison-ivy,”
Orilla snarled, while Nancy gave her entire
attention to the unfortunate cousin.</p>

<p>“Put your arm under her other arm,” she
ordered Orilla. “Her ankle is hurt, you know,”
she finished sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“Oh yes, I know,” sneered the red-haired
one. But nevertheless she did as Nancy
Brandon ordered her to do.</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span>A STRANGE RESCUE</span></h2>


<p>Although both Nancy and Orilla gave all
their strength to the task, it was only with
great difficulty that they succeeded in getting
poor Rosa over to the pavilion.</p>

<p>“Now try,” insisted Orilla for times repeated,
“not to attract attention. It’s awful
to be always getting in scrapes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orilla Rigney! You just hush!” spoke up
Rosa quite unexpectedly. “You make me
sick. One would think I did this purposely,
when I was merely following&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Land sakes, you hush!” begged Orilla,
her tone of voice changing instantly from that
of the arrogant boss to that of the humble
petitioner. “I know it was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you? Nice of you, I’m sure. I guess
I know it&mdash;ouch!” A necessarily sudden move
took all the courage from Rosa. She sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
down upon the edge of the platform, her arms
actually clutching at Nancy’s knees.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to be such a baby,”
snapped Orilla.</p>

<p>“Better a baby than a fool,” quarreled Rosa.</p>

<p>“Please don’t excite yourself, Rosa,” begged
Nancy. “The thing to do now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, let her talk,” sneered Orilla. “That’s
the best thing she can do&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I won’t let <em>you</em> talk in that voice without&mdash;without
talking back,” spoke up Nancy.
“At least you are old enough to have sense&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If I were able I’d love this three-cornered
fight,” put in Rosa, attempting to prevent
that very thing. “But as it is&mdash;well, I can see
myself in dry-dock all summer.”</p>

<p>“For a scratched ankle!” again sneered
Orilla.</p>

<p>But Nancy had made up her mind. They
were now safe upon the lighted platform, and
she was going at once to find Dell, and she
hoped Gar would be with her. Scarcely waiting
to explain this to Rosa&mdash;Orilla she could
not help ignoring&mdash;she hurried off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“But do hurry back, Nancy,” begged Rosa,
whose face could now be seen and it showed
her suffering. “I’m nearly dead&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a baby,” Nancy again heard
Orilla mutter, just as she hurried off.</p>

<p>Dancers impeded her way, and she was
obliged to do some skillful dodging in and out
of the movements to avoid actual collision.
But Nancy scarcely saw them. Neither did
she hear the jolly music, for it seemed to her
tragic that such an accident should befall
Rosa. It was only human for Nancy to feel
impending gloom, so far as her vacation was
concerned, but her dislike for Orilla, and the
little mother instinct that so spontaneously
went forth to save Rosa, had more to do with
her thoughts than any possible loss of good
times.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got something to do,” she was
telling herself as she peered into face after face,
hoping to pick out that of Dell or Gar Durand.</p>

<p>“Looking for us, too, I suppose,” she sighed.
Then, realizing that they must know Rosa and
her habits better than she did, came the discouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
fear that they too might be off in
the woods&mdash;hunting for Rosa.</p>

<p>Moments seemed like hours, and every time
Nancy espied someone who looked a little bit
like Dell and presently found she was mistaken,
her resources would wane.</p>

<p>“If it had been any other time,” she couldn’t
help grumbling, “when I knew persons and
places. But the very first night&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Woo-hoo!” came a call. Then: “Nan-cee!”</p>

<p>“Oh, there she is!” cried Nancy aloud,
disregarding those around her. “Dell!” she
called. “Here I am!”</p>

<p>In a moment Dell, her own face showing
relief at the locating of Nancy, sprang up to
her side and just grabbed her.</p>

<p>“You runaway! Where ever have you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh Dell, do hurry!” whispered Nancy.
“Where is your brother?”</p>

<p>“Child! What is it?”</p>

<p>“Rosa’s hurt.” The words were driven
straight into Dell’s anxious ears.</p>

<p>“Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
“Hush,” warned Nancy. “Can you get
your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He started at the other end. Don’t
leave this spot. See, it’s the big post&mdash;” and
Dell was off to locate her brother.</p>

<p>Briefly, very briefly, Nancy attempted to
give Dell and Garfield some account of Rosa’s
troubles, as presently they were all hurrying
toward the sequestered spot where Rosa waited.
She did not mention Orilla&mdash;somehow she
felt that Rosa would not have wanted her to.
Better let her cousin explain that angle, Nancy
wisely decided.</p>

<p>But before they had actually come up to
Rosa, Nancy saw that she was alone: that
Orilla had left her!</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor darling!” exclaimed Dell with
genuine sympathy. “To think you were here
all alone, and we were hunting&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Slipped off into the rocks,” said Rosa
simply, “and not even a life-guard around.
Gar, how are you going to tow me in?”</p>

<p>“How come?” asked the boy. “Something
‘busted’, really?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
“A leg or two,” replied Rosa, “and it hurts
like thunder, if you must know the horrible
details. Give me a lift. Margot will have the
fire department out&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait till I get the car. There’s a lane along
here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Trust Gar to know the lanes,” said Rosa,
her spirits soaring with the presence of her
friends.</p>

<p>In snatches she and Nancy told Dell something
of what had happened&mdash;just something.
It did not seem necessary to speak of Orilla,
although there was a gap in her story when Rosa
insisted she had simply been bound by ropes
of briars and couldn’t possibly break loose.
It was taken for granted then that she did
eventually, somehow, “break loose”, and the
actual “chopping out” was thus entirely
omitted from the recital.</p>

<p>A welcome little toot from the horn of Gar’s
car told them that he had made his way
through the lane, and the next moment he was
again upon the platform, planning how best
to get Rosa into the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
No one joked about her size, nor did they
blame her for the predicament, for it was
rather a serious matter, as each understood
it, and only Rosa herself was privileged to do
any joking.</p>

<p>“I can limp if you’ll promise me not to let
me step for a single step on that game ankle,”
she told her friends. “I never knew <em>one</em> ankle
could hurt as badly as this does.”</p>

<p>Gar and Dell insisted upon doing the lifting,
as they really were much stronger than
Nancy, so with the car lights to guide them,
they practically carried Rosa through the
little patch that separated the pavilion from
the roadway.</p>

<p>Even so, the journey was not accomplished
without groans, grunts and admonitions, and
it was growing more clear to Nancy each
moment that the fat cousin was really quite
a baby after all.</p>

<p>She wondered what had become of Orilla.
It seemed improbable she should have entirely
deserted the injured girl, and as the car was
cautiously backed out into the clearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Nancy kept watching for little flashes of the
light which Orilla had carried.</p>

<p>Deeper resentment bore down upon her,
however, as they finally made the main road
without a single flash sending forth a secret
farewell signal.</p>

<p>“How can Rosa be so indifferent to such
treatment?” Nancy kept asking herself.
“And why ever does she bother with that
girl?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gar, from his place at the wheel,
could be heard questioning Rosa. She was
sitting in front because that position was
deemed the easiest riding, and now, as they
all sped off toward Fernlode, some of the terrors
of the accident seemed lifted.</p>

<p>“No fooling now, Rosa,” Gar was saying,
“how did that happen? <em>You</em> can’t fool me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Gar Durand! How does a broken leg ever
happen? It just breaks, doesn’t it?” evaded
Rosa.</p>

<p>“Not just like that, it doesn’t. It has to
<em>get</em> broken, and I’ll bet a peanut you were up
to something&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
“The dopy-doc has got to fix you up, Rosa,
you know,” interrupted Dell. “Perhaps we
had better pick him up or give him a call on
our way out. You know what a fuss he makes
about night visits.”</p>

<p>“Margot would simply pass away and we’d
have a double funeral, if we brought the dopy-doc
up to the house, bodily,” replied Rosa.
“Not that I want him a&mdash;tall&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Better get him,” insisted Gar. “I can’t
keep lugging you around&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As if I’d <em>let</em> you!” Rosa parried.</p>

<p>“If you keep on getting better this way,
Rosa,” put in Nancy, “I don’t believe you’ll
need any doctor.”</p>

<p>“Bright idea! Wonderful coz! I don’t
want the dopy-doc,” exclaimed Rosa. “Why
should I have him until&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We are sure,” drawled Gar, “that the injuries
are fatal.”</p>

<p>“Fatal?” repeated his sister. “You mean
serious.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t either. I mean&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ouch!” yelled Rosa. “There you all go;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
mocking me. That’s the worst it has hurt&mdash;yet&mdash;”</p>

<p>Which turn of affairs fully decided Dell,
for she gave definite orders then that Gar
should stop for Doctor Easton, loquaciously
called by Rosa, the dopy-doc.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him to come out tonight,” she
declared in the face of Rosa’s pleas and protests.
“Can’t tell what a game ankle may do,
and while I’m in charge&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly right,” insisted Nancy
under her breath, rejoicing that someone
would take Rosa in actual charge.</p>

<p>“And we’ll all be so late&mdash;” grumbled Gar,
in that good-natured way boys have, “that
our family will have the megaphone out.
Nancy,” he said politely, remembering that
she was, after all, something of a stranger,
“whenever you hear the megaphone you’ll
know there is nothing the matter. It’s mother’s
warning to be careful of the water.”</p>

<p>“Now watch Margot take a fit when she
sees you help me&mdash;please don’t call Baldy,
Dell, he uses hair-oil,” said Rosa, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
car was pulled up in front of the side porch
and the girls with Gar were promptly alighting,
“and he’s sure to sling me over his
shoulder, if he gets the chance.”</p>

<p>The next half hour was consumed in getting
Rosa installed in her bed and “fussed up”, as
Nancy put it, and also in the appeasing of
Margot, who would not be satisfied with the
account of the accident.</p>

<p>“Turned on her ankle!” insisted Dell.</p>

<p>“Turned on her ankle,” reiterated Gar, who
just “hung around” waiting for the doctor.</p>

<p>“Really, I can’t see&mdash;” moaned the distressed
woman.</p>

<p>“But it’s only her ankle,” chanted Nancy.</p>

<p>“Say Maggie,” sang out Rosalind, from her
billowy pillows, “do you want me to have
something else the matter? Because if you
do I can exhibit a wonderful array of
scratches&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The doctor,” announced Margot, solemnly.</p>

<p>“The doctor,” repeated Rosalind, comically.</p>

<p>“The dopy-doc,” whispered Dell. “Let
you and me escape, Nan,” she suggested.</p>

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span>LOVELY LADY BETTY</span></h2>


<p>It seems the ankle was not sprained after
all. Rosa spent one day trying on all her
sick-spell caps, the little gifts she had not yet
had a chance to wear, trying on her fancy
silk robes&mdash;there was that beauty, Betty had
brought her from Paris, it was glorious and
she had never really worn it before.</p>

<p>Nancy never before had seen such beautiful
things, and Rosa insisted that she too try
some of them on. It was in this way the
cousin tactfully bestowed upon Nancy a lot
of pretty things “just presents I should have
sent on Christmas and on birthdays,” insisted
Rosa.</p>

<p>“But wait until Dad and Betty come,”
threatened Rosa. “They’ll want me all put
in splints, see if they don’t. Betty seems to
think I’ll melt, like gelatine, if I’m left out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the ice-box,” she finished, a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“Now, Rosa,” objected Nancy, “maybe
you’re not fair. I can guess that Betty feels
like your mother, even if she isn’t, and that
would make her worry a lot more about you.
Since I’ve been away from my mother I know
what a lot of things she has been doing for me,
in spite of keeping up her library business.
My clothes seem to be all upset already&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give them to Margot, she adores fixing
clothes,” interrupted Rosa, losing the point
Nancy had tried to make regarding the pretty
step-mother. “I honestly do believe she
musses my things up just for the joy of
straightening them out again.”</p>

<p>“How funny! But I don’t really mean that
I can’t look after my things, Rosa,” explained
Nancy, “although I did use to think no girl
in the world could hate such work more than
I did&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind it a bit,” interrupted Rosa
grandly. “I often wash out laces and my fine
stockings&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Nancy with one of her twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
smiles, “I don’t mind just that, either. But
Rosa, hadn’t you better get off that foot?
You’ve been standing on it for almost half
an hour.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Coz,” agreed Rosa, who
did seem strangely willing to agree with most
of Nancy’s suggestions. “You don’t know
what this ankle means to me. I haven’t told
you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Nancy, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Oh, something&mdash;great!” and the baby blue
eyes fairly whirled around in Rosa’s face as
she turned them up, down, from right to left
and then the other way, expressing the
wonderment she had so vaguely hinted at.</p>

<p>“Think you might tell me,” teased Nancy.
In fact the big secret between Rosa and Orilla
was growing more and more mystifying to the
visitor.</p>

<p>“I do intend to tell you, of course, Nancy,”
confided Rosa, her face falling into the rarely
serious lines which this subject could provoke.
“But not just&mdash;yet.” She drawled these last
words intentionally and the refusal to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
her question piqued Nancy. In fact, she
dropped Rosa’s prettiest scarf down in a heap
without even pretending to fold it.</p>

<p>“Mad?” teased Rosa.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. But Rosa, it is queer,
the way you act about that girl.” She just
couldn’t say Orilla.</p>

<p>“Nan-cee.” Rosa had both her arms around
the pouting cousin. “You’re not jealous!
You see&mdash;oh, you see I haven’t had any body
else; not anybody, and Orilla has been kind
to me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Even Gar doesn’t like her,” flung back
Nancy.</p>

<p>“No, that’s so. He hates her. But then
you see, I’ve been an awful nuisance to Gar
on account of it all.”</p>

<p>“How&mdash;a nuisance?”</p>

<p>“Nancy Brandon, you’re what my dad calls
an idealist!” exclaimed Rosa, bubbling back
into her usual jolly mood. “Know what that
is? I’ve looked it up for it’s dad’s pet word.
It means one who&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ideals I suppose,” said Nancy, herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
recovering the good humored mood. “Well,
never mind, Rosa. Just so long as you don’t
run away any more, or break any more ankles,
I won’t mind,” and she wound the lately
despised scarf around Rosa’s plump shoulders,
with great affectation.</p>

<p>It was turning out to be a rainy day, so that
the girls’ enforced idleness was not a real hardship.
They were having a splendid time,
especially Nancy, who, being just a normal
girl, delighted in seeing beautiful clothes.
And Rosa did have them&mdash;stacks of them.
Not only was she the possessor of gowns by the
dozen, but the finest of silk underthings, some
of them so cob-webby that Nancy frankly
questioned their utility.</p>

<p>“Please don’t give me anything else, Rosa,”
she pleaded. “I shan’t know what to do with
such finery.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, love,” replied Rosa. “Nobody
knows exactly what to do with them
until they’ve been worn a time or two. That’s
dad’s joke about the man’s boots, you know.
He couldn’t get them on until after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
worn them a time or two!”</p>

<p>“Pretty good!” agreed Nancy. “I’ll remember
that. But Rosa&mdash;oh, here comes the
car!”</p>

<p>“With Betty and dad. Let me get into
bed. I must look sick enough to ward off a
scolding!”</p>

<p>She dropped such bits of clothing as she
had been draping herself in, and scuttled into
bed. Nancy felt quite nervous enough at the
prospect of meeting the pretty Lady Betty,
but with Rosa’s condition to be explained,
the home-coming seemed rather exciting.</p>

<p>Margot rushed into the bedroom. “Your
father is coming, my dear child,” she pronounced,
“and Mrs. Betty. Now please don’t
get them all worried and anxious&mdash;” she
paused as she patted the innumerable pillows.</p>

<p>“Get them worried! Indeed! And my
poor foot&mdash;Hello, Daddy!” called out Rosalind.
“My leg’s broke!”</p>

<p>The bombastic greeting was taken up by
her daddy who promptly and lustily shouted:</p>

<p>“Hello, Rosalinda! Which leg?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Proudly Rosa stuck the injured member,
in its white bandages, outside the bed covering.</p>

<p>“That one! ‘Busted’ badly!” <a name="she" id="she"></a><ins title="Original has 'She'">she</ins> mocked.
“But Daddy, there’s Nancy. She’s scared to
death of me, Nancy, come over here&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nancy knew Rosa’s father, the handsome
Uncle Frederic who had visited them in their
own little home, so she was not at all embarrassed
in greeting him.</p>

<p>He was as tall and handsome as ever, Nancy
could not help noticing, and his welcome to her
made her feel almost comfortable&mdash;if only she
had the meeting of his new wife over with.</p>

<p>“Where’s Betty?” asked Rosa, rather quietly
when her father had taken his place beside
her bed.</p>

<p>“She’ll be along presently. We had rather
a tiring drive&mdash;the roads are in their usual bad
summer condition. But tell me about the
accident, Linda? How did it all happen?”</p>

<p>As father and daughter talked, Nancy
noticed how particular he was to know as much
and more than Rosa seemed anxious to tell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
He was most solicitous about Rosa’s condition,
however, and so affectionate that he called her
a different name each time he addressed her,
yet he was very positive in his manner.
Evidently, he was not too sure of his
daughter’s prudence.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s all right for you to go out
to the park with Garfield and Adell,” he said,
“but never alone, Rosy-kins, not even with
Nancy and in the day-time. Remember,
I don’t want to have you lost in the New
Hampshire forests, you know.”</p>

<p>Rosa fairly glowed under her father’s interest
and affection. Sitting by the window
and watching this play, Nancy realized what
Rosa’s father meant to her&mdash;just what
Nancy’s mother meant to Nancy.</p>

<p>“We don’t know until we are away from it,”
she reasoned, choking back the wave of
home-sickness that threatened to creep over
her. “I don’t see why Rosa thinks she is left
out of everything; that she is too fat to be
happy,” went on Nancy’s deliberation. “Her
father just idolizes her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
A little flutter from the doorway seemed to
answer that, for presently the lovely Betty&mdash;Lady
Betty, as Nancy was privately calling
the new aunt, appeared before them.</p>

<p>She <em>was</em> lovely; Nancy conceded that instantly,
and surrounding her, like a halo of
loveliness, was a faint something which recalled
to Nancy the perfection of Miss Manners’
hand-made laces&mdash;a combination of inspiration
and perfectly chosen materials. No
wonder her Uncle Frederic had been fascinated
by Betty Burnett. Surely she was lovely.</p>

<p>“Sweet-heart!” she almost sang to Rosalind.
“What has happened to you? Don’t
tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Busted me leg!” sang back Rosa, impishly.
“But, Betty dear, there’s Nancy. You are
going to love her because she&mdash;is skinny!”</p>

<p>The next few moments were lost to Nancy
in her confusing introduction. Betty was
being kind, kind to the point of gush, Nancy
feared, but then Rosa had been absurdly
blunt and so had sort of challenged their
meeting. The explosion of slang betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Rosa’s own feelings. She was insisting that
Betty would love a thin girl and intimating
broadly that she hated fat ones.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, and especially
a little later when Uncle Frederic had arranged
his wife’s blue cushions in the big blue
bird chair (Betty was, of course, a dainty
blonde), Nancy found her eyes devouring the
picture.</p>

<p>This was the wonderful, the beautiful
Betty who had taken&mdash;so Rosa said&mdash;Rosa’s
place in the tall iron-gray man’s heart. Who
had put Orilla out of what she had been
brought up to consider her home, and worst
of all, if true, it was she who had brought unhappiness
to little Rosa, because her own
flawless beauty was contrasting so painfully
with the ungraceful lines of Rosalind Fernell.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Nancy Brandon
was a girl whose home influence was almost
opposite that of Rosa’s. Her mother
and brother Ted were dear, darling chums, all
and each a part of the other’s existence. Also,
that Nancy’s mother was employed in a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
library, so that books had become a real part
of Nancy’s life. And books are very good
friends indeed. They almost always try to
make folks more tolerant and more reasonable
with their surroundings and companions.</p>

<p>But here was Rosa, a girl who only read
books when she had to, or when Margot
threatened her with something worse to do.
She had had little chance to learn the simple
things that stood for so much in Nancy’s life,
and while Nancy could not have reasoned this
way, it is only fair to understand Rosa and
her peculiar self-made troubles.</p>

<p>Lady Betty was not exerting herself very
much, in spite of Rosa’s predicament. There
had been the tiring drive, as Uncle Frederic
had explained, and there was the sea-going
voyage to-morrow&mdash;as everybody knew.</p>

<p>And Nancy was glad they were going away.
Rosa had been positively rebellious ever since
the pretty Betty had come into her room.
Was it sheer nervousness? Nancy wondered.
How perfectly silly for Rosa to keep sticking
that bandaged foot outside the lace-edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
sheet. And how absurd for her to keep using
such senseless slang! Calling it a “busted
foot” and insisting that she was “laid up for
repairs”&mdash;it sounded like pure affectation to
Nancy, who, while being no prude, was not a
rebel, either.</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span>ROSALIND’S SORROWS</span></h2>


<p>During the half hour that Lady Betty
favored them with her presence, no mention
was made of Orilla. It was all a jumbling
talk of what to get Rosa in Europe, and what
Rosa should do while they were away.</p>

<p>“You see, Nancy dear,” said Mrs. Betty.
“I left my little pet Pompsie&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Her dog,” interrupted Rosa.</p>

<p>“Rosa-linda!” exclaimed her father, rebukingly.</p>

<p>“Well, how would Nancy know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I left my little dog with my sister, because
Rosa might forget and lock him out on the
roof some night. He adores to play on the
roof&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then Margot appeared with a very small
silver tray. It held a card which she handed
to Lady Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
“Oh, dear!” she sighed. “Fred, there’s the
Prestons. Suppose you go down, like a love,
while I slip into something. Rosa and Nancy
be good girls. Nancy, your name is a hymn
to me, it was also my grandmother’s. She
was a cameo lady, beautiful beyond words.”</p>

<p>“No relation to our Nancy, then,” again
spoke the impish Rosa.</p>

<p>Both girls were brazenly glad when their
elders were gone, and in spite of Margot’s unwelcome
ministrations, Rosa hopped out of
bed, pushed Margot outside, shut the door,
turned the key and undertook to execute an
original dance, sort of “skippity-hop-to-the-barber-shop”
fashion.</p>

<p>“Now you see, you see,” she paused to tell
Nancy, “just what I’m up&mdash;against!”</p>

<p>“Rosalind Fernell!” exclaimed Nancy. “Do
you know you are just too silly for anything?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I am.” The girl with the flying
scarf came to a very abrupt stop and seemed
to confront Nancy. “But I just want to tell
you I can’t love Betty. She’s too dollified.
Makes me feel like a&mdash;like a clown.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
voice, usually so flippant, had suddenly become
almost tragic. “And that’s why, Nancy
Brandon,” continued the indignant Rosa,
“I’m going to become less&mdash;clownish!”</p>

<p>“Rosa!”</p>

<p>Tears, tears unmistakable had gathered in
the soft blue eyes, and Nancy was panic
stricken at their appearance. She couldn’t
bear to cry herself, and she hated even worse
than that to see any one else cry. And now,
here was Rosa on the verge!</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to have it out!” moaned
Rosa, dropping down again into her pillows.
“Every time I see her I feel just the same.
Oh, why couldn’t daddy be satisfied with me?
We were such&mdash;such&mdash;chums&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nancy felt too much like agreeing with this
to offer any sensible advice, but she felt called
upon to try.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she loves you, Rosa. You just
think she’s selfish&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;go&mdash;preaching. I just hate it,
Nancy. And I’ve got an awful&mdash;temper.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” calmly replied Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
This brought Rosa’s tear-stained face up
from the pillows.</p>

<p>“Have you&mdash;honestly? That’s because
we’re real cousins. Of course, Betty isn’t any
real relation to me.” Rosa seemed very glad
of that.</p>

<p>“Guess we are something alike,” persisted
Nancy, glad to change the subject. “We’ve
both got&mdash;big&mdash;mouths&mdash;”</p>

<p>This was too much for Rosa. She simply
roared, shouted, laughing, as so often a tiny
child will, in the very face of its own tears.</p>

<p>“Big mouths!” she repeated. “Haven’t we,
though? Big, long, square mouths like, like
prize fighters.”</p>

<p>“No,” objected Nancy, “like Abraham
Lincoln’s&mdash;”</p>

<p>This precipitated another gale of laughter,
and only the insistent knocking, known to be
Margot’s, for her voice accompanied the demand,
brought the two girls back from their
gleeful frolic.</p>

<p>“You are coming down to dinner,” ordered
Margot, trying to make sure that her command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
would be obeyed.</p>

<p>“I certainly am <em>not</em>,” fired back Rosa.</p>

<p>“But why? You can walk. I even heard
you dance&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You ought to <em>see</em> me dance, Margot,” answered
the irrepressible Rosa. “Hearing me,
isn’t the half of it. Seeing me is well worth
while. But, Margot,” down dropped Rosa’s
tone to one of entreaty, “you be a lamb, and
fix up a gor-gee-ous tray for me and Nancy.
Just this once, Margot. You know how I
feel&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosalind, I’m honestly afraid that Mrs.
Fernell will blame me for your conduct.”
Margot drew her lips into so straight a line
they didn’t look like lips at all.</p>

<p>“Do come down, Rosa,” pleaded Nancy,
feeling very uncomfortable because of this
willful girl’s obstinacy. It was bad enough to
be away from home, but to have to keep up
this battle seemed unreasonable to Nancy.</p>

<p>“Not to-night. Please don’t any one ask
me,” and again tears threatened Rosa’s eyes.
“If you don’t want to bother with my tray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Margot, just ask Baldy when he has time.
There’s&mdash;no&mdash;hurry&mdash;”</p>

<p>This appeal brought about the result plainly
desired by Rosa, for not only did Margot
agree to the request, but she went much
further. She wrote out the dinner menu,
and from this list of fine food Rosa made her
selection, first politely consulting Nancy’s
taste.</p>

<p>“We live so differently,” explained Nancy,
who was now losing much of the natural timidity
following her introduction into this home.
“You see, we don’t even keep a maid&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, how jolly!” declared Rosa. “They’re
a set of spies.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that, Rosa,” defended
Nancy. “Why should a girl, who happens
to be a maid, in any way be inferior&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because she’s a maid,” insisted Rosa.</p>

<p>“But if you had to work, for instance, what
would you be?”</p>

<p>“I’d run a beauty parlor,” declared Rosa,
thus betraying anxiety concerning her own
personal appearance. “What would you do?”
she countered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
“Well,” Nancy hesitated, “you know I’ve
always declared I hated housework. In fact,
I suppose I don’t really love it now, but last
summer we had a cooking class at our little
cottage, and really, Rosa, you have no idea
how much fun there is in learning things with
a lot of jolly girls.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather boys,” said contrary Rosa, “I’d
like to learn to chop down trees and load guns
and fish&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” agreed Nancy, “but, you
see, I knew all that. Ted and I are regular
campers-out, and we’ve done almost everything
woodsy. Mother loves it too, so we’ve
spent more time on hikes and in camps than
we ever have under civilized roofs.”</p>

<p>“You lucky dogs!” broke out Rosa, “I can’t
imagine having a mother who could actually
stay out of doors all night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Mother’s a real sport,” declared
Nancy proudly. “But I doubt if you would
like hiking and camping, Rosa. It’s terribly
hard on&mdash;on beauty,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Good for it! The best thing in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
It’s this soft living that is making such a fluffy,
fat caterpillar out of me.”</p>

<p>“But caterpillars turn to butterflies&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? That’s why, Nancy,”
hinted Rosa very mysteriously. “That’s exactly&mdash;why!”</p>

<p>“Why what?” demanded Nancy, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Hush! Sh-hh! Whish-th!” hissed Rosa,
her sibilant sounds imitating the desired silence.
“Don’t you know, pretty Coz, that’s
the Great Secret?”</p>

<p>“What Great Secret?” Nancy flung up her
head defiantly.</p>

<p>“Mine,” replied Rosa crisply. “Here’s the
trays.”</p>

<p>For some moments Nancy showed her feelings,
in fact, she almost pouted, for, she decided,
if Rosa was going to keep up this attitude
of mystery, and keep hinting at things,
what fun was she, Nancy, going to have out
of this long and almost lonely summer?</p>

<p>Possibly sensing her resentment, Rosa hurried
to explain.</p>

<p>“When the folks are gone and we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
everything to ourselves,” she began, “of
course, things will be different.”</p>

<p>Nancy brightened at this. Her cousin was
a very different girl from all Nancy’s other
friends, it was only fair to give her a chance&mdash;a
different sort of chance to what any other
of Nancy’s chums might have expected.</p>

<p>The dinner served on Rosa’s pretty heart-shaped
table proved a treat indeed.</p>

<p>“Lots more fun than eating in the dining
room with Baldy at one’s elbow,” declared
Nancy. “But it may seem strange to Betty&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Betty! She hasn’t gone down either,”
replied Rosa. “Catch her sitting up straight
for half an hour with only dear dad to applaud.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” echoed Nancy. “I’m glad she won’t
miss us, because mother warned me most particularly
to be punctual at meals.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, love. They’ll be gone early
in the morning, then we can eat our meals on
the rocks&mdash;if you’re not afraid of lizards,
snakes, chipmunks and otters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
“I’m not,” said Nancy, dryly.</p>

<p>“You promised to tell me about last summer,”
Rosa reminded her. “How you got
won over to the cooking class scheme.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” and Nancy started in on her
orange sherbert just as she started in on the
story. “Well, you see, we have always kept
rather busy. We live that way. It wouldn’t
be fair to let mother work in the library while
Ted and I just&mdash;ran loose&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it?” asked Rosa innocently.
“You two kids couldn’t work in a library.”</p>

<p>“No, but we could learn how to do something,”
fended Nancy. “Mother didn’t learn
just how to do that either, she simply did it
because she knew she should.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, certainly,” spoke up Rosa rather
apologetically. “Don’t think that I don’t
appreciate your mother, Nance. Dad thinks
she’s the best little woman there is, but I just
didn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of things that neither of us
understand,” answered Nancy, suddenly digressing.
“I suppose it is because you and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
have such different lives. There I live in a
Massachusetts town and have only spent my
summers at little places just outside, while
you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t live anywhere,” moaned Rosa. “I
just go from one place to the other like a suitcase
or a hat box. School in Connecticut,
winters in New York or maybe Boston, vacations
in the craziest places in the world, until
this summer. I just insisted upon staying
here in my own dear mother’s place. She
<em>loved</em> Fernlode.”</p>

<p>Gulping on the confection which she should
not have eaten, Rosa showed genuine love for
the mother who had gone. Respecting her
feelings, it was some time before Nancy broke
the silence, but when she did so it was of that
jolly summer&mdash;last summer&mdash;at Long Leigh
that she talked. She told Rosa all about the
Whatnot Shop, about dear little Miss Manners,
who had since become one of Nancy’s
family by making her simple, humble home
with them, and gladly assuming such cares as
Nancy’s mother allowed her to take over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
The fun every one had in the cistern mystery
just sent Rosa off into gales of laughter as
Nancy told of it, and while this was the story
of Nancy Brandon: Enthusiast, as told in volume
one of this series, it was easy to understand
how the two cousins enjoyed its telling.</p>

<p>Presently there was a tap at the door, then
Margot entered.</p>

<p>“The Durand’s are here&mdash;but you mustn’t
think of going out, Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m going!” threatened the girl with the
bandaged ankle, again up “in arms.”</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span>THE CURE FOR QUARRELS</span></h2>


<p>As if to make positive that she intended to
do exactly as she pleased, especially if the doing
of it were opposed by the anxious Margot,
Rosa rushed to dress.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in long enough,” she assured
Nancy, “I’d die if I were cooped up here any
longer. I phoned Gar, told him the doctor
said I had to go out&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosa!” Nancy’s manner showed more disappointment
than shock.</p>

<p>“Now, Nannily, don’t go getting excited.
My ankle wasn’t bad, really. It was just fun
to have a lot of attention. You have no idea
how precious little of it I get, usually.”</p>

<p>Nancy sighed. Her own vivid personality
felt eclipsed beside the turbulent, changeable
cousin. She, Nancy, simply had to be polite
and accept things as Rosa offered them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
with each new turn she found herself more and
more baffled. Even if she were company and
had to appear pleased with things, she was
feeling rather tired of Rosa’s whims. They
weren’t funny at all; not half so funny as just
anything that Ted would do. But why think
of Ted now? He was having a fine time with
boys at a boys’ camp, and Nancy was wishing
she had gone to a girls’ camp with Ruth Ashley.</p>

<p>“What are you going to put on?” asked
Rosa very casually, too casually to be taken
as Rosa tried to make it.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to change,” replied Nancy.
“I’m not going out.”</p>

<p>“Not going out!” exclaimed Rosa, as if
such a contingency had never occurred to her.
“Why, Nancy <em>I’m</em> going.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Nancy. This was casual.</p>

<p>“But <em>I</em> want you to come,” Rosa’s voice
was a key higher.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but <em>I</em> don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>Following that surprising statement Rosa
rushed around, tossing helpless garments from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
one end of the room to another, as if taking her
spite out on them. She wasn’t saying a word
to Nancy; Nancy wasn’t saying a word to her.</p>

<p>Presently Margot came in for the trays,
and as she gathered things up she made known
her disapproval of Rosa’s conduct.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to scold, Rosalind, when your
cousin has just come, and your father is leaving&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, go ahead and scold, Maggie,” said
Rosa impertinently. “Get it out of your system.
Your eyes look bulgy and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosalind! I will not take any impudence.
You know that,” replied Margot quite properly.
“You may be too big to be put in a
corner, but you <em>would</em> miss your allowance,
and I’ve got to have some control of you if I
am to be responsible for your welfare.”</p>

<p>At this threat, that her allowance would be
withheld if she did not do better, Rosa quieted
down&mdash;some. She stopped throwing things
around but she did not speak to Nancy.
Neither did Nancy speak to her. In fact, she
felt like doing almost anything else, for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
vacation was being spoiled just because Rosa
was so obstinate.</p>

<p>If only she hadn’t come! If only she had
gone with patient little Miss Manners, who
loved her. Certainly Rosa couldn’t care anything
about her and treat her this way.</p>

<p>Once Nancy started on this line of reasoning
the inevitable was bound to happen. In
feeling sorry for herself she was going to become
homesick!</p>

<p>“I should think you would be ashamed&mdash;”
began Margot, but Rosa checked her.</p>

<p>“I am, if that’s any good to know. I’m
always ashamed, but you don’t have to make
it worse, Margot.”</p>

<p>Nancy glanced over at Rosa, who was doing
what she usually did in dressing: trying to
make her waist line look smaller by actually
making it look larger. She was pulling a
girdle in so tight that the rebellious little
bunches of flesh pouched out in pudgy pockets
above and below.</p>

<p>She was ashamed&mdash;of being too fat! As
Nancy realized this her resentment cooled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
She did love Rosalind and perhaps Rosalind
loved her. Just because Rosa was too stout
and not wise enough to understand that such
a thing has little, if anything, to do with personality,
her young life was being embittered.
She imagined that every one slighted her; that
every one laughed at her; that every one was
making fun of her. Whereas, she was only a
growing girl with her growth unbalanced.</p>

<p>The dark blue dress that Rosa was adjusting
might have been a school uniform in the severity
of its lines; but Rosa had declared she
could only wear dark colors; that Orilla had
told her so.</p>

<p>The longer both girls held silence against
each other, the harder it was going to be to
break it. Nancy was not ungenerous, but she
was human, and no girl wants to “give in”
when she feels herself to have been the one
injured. Margot noticed this set expression,
and the girls’ lack of conversation. Also, she
noticed Nancy biting her lip.</p>

<p>“Not quarreling with your cousin, I hope,
Rosalind,” said the woman severely. “I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
believe I shall have to have a talk with your
father.”</p>

<p>“He’d love it,” scoffed Rosa, saucily.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Margot with finality, “I
shall.”</p>

<p>The butler had been in twice for the trays
and now everything was cleared away. Rosa
was dressed, hatted and coated, and she was
only pretending to fuss with her hair. Nancy
jumped up and with a hasty “I’m going to
read, Rosa,” flew into her own room.</p>

<p>She knew this would make matters worse;
that the only time to stop a quarrel is before
it starts, but Nancy was not equal, just then,
to reasonable arguments. All she could see,
feel or know, was that she wished she were
almost any place else than at Fernlode.</p>

<p>Being away from home, visiting and having
things unpleasant! It was so easy to bring
tears to her eyes now, and she so rarely cried
at home. She just had to choke back the
tears that were forcing themselves up her
throat and trying to reach her eyes.</p>

<p>Why should she have been made so miserable?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Why was Rosa so unreasonable? What
if she was fat, wasn’t Nancy thin? Didn’t
her friends always call her “skinny” and she
hadn’t even bothered about it any more than
she had fussed over the “Nincy-niney-nanny-notey
in a red petticoaty,” Ted’s fighting
chant or battle cry, as their mother always
termed his childish taunt.</p>

<p>Rosa was going downstairs&mdash;Nancy heard
her grumbling as she went, and it seemed
Margot had carried out her threat, for Rosa
was talking back and scoffing at the commands
evidently sent by her father.</p>

<p>“Serves her right!” was Nancy’s first impulsive
criticism. Then again came the
thought of Ted. How she and he would
quarrel, how she would declare she hoped her
mother would do all sorts of things to him
(which, of course, she never did), and then in
the end, just as Ted was realizing that something
in the way of discipline might possibly
be visited upon him, Nancy would always relent.
She would even step between him and
the impending evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
That was exactly how she felt now. After
all, Rosa was such a baby. She hadn’t learned
from contact with companions, for, according
to her own story, she had never had a real
chum.</p>

<p>“Ted, Ted, Ted!” kept persistingly challenging
Nancy, until she knew she would have
to do something for Rosa. It was not being
generous, really, it was just doing what she
had been brought up to do&mdash;to be brave
enough to be humble.</p>

<p>She flew to her mirror and daubbed at her
eyes; they looked rather puckery. Then she
flirted her powder puff around her nose, that
looked decidedly shiny.</p>

<p>“Wish I had put on my red dress,” she told
her reflection in the glass, “but there’s no time
now. If I run along with Rosa, surely Uncle
Frederic won’t scold her.”</p>

<p>On the broad stair landing, where the big
brass lanterns and the lovely soft palms
opened the way into the living room, she
found the surprised Rosa.</p>

<p>“Why, Nancy!” she exclaimed. “I
thought&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
“But I don’t care for that book,” said
Nancy evasively. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Horrid old Margot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! Let’s make believe we’re&mdash;where’s
Dell? I thought she was here.”</p>

<p>“Gone. She was here. Dad said I couldn’t
go out. They’re going to the park&mdash;” Rosa’s
voice was full of rancor.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go out in the cove in your flat-bottom
boat? I love to row, and it’s safe in
the cove, isn’t it?” asked Nancy, glad to think
of a reasonable plan.</p>

<p>“Too safe. Like swimming doll ducks in
the bath tub. But we’ll go. I’ll ask dad.
He&mdash;has&mdash;summoned me&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then, down the long hall strode the
gentleman in question. He was waving a
paper at Nancy.</p>

<p>“A letter for you, Antoinette,” he announced
gaily. “A steamer letter from your
mother&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” exclaimed Nancy happily.
“Come on, Rosa. Let’s read it.”</p>

<p>“But dad wants to see me&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
“Oh, never mind, Boots,” he replied, just
giving the willful one a playful shake. “Give
dad a kiss and promise&mdash;promise to be good.”</p>

<p>Whereat Rosa actually sprang upon the
foot with the injured ankle, hugging her
father so impulsively that Nancy instantly
decided she was just like Ted.</p>

<p>Is there anything lovelier than the calm
after the storm? Arm in arm Rosa and
Nancy sauntered off, their happy laughter
ringing through old Fernlode, their voices
blending in genuine affection until reaching
the water’s edge, Rosa showed Nancy how she
“megaphoned” down the lake to No Man’s
Land, a little island, desolate and alone.
Nancy did the phoning by cupping her hands
and shouting in the weird way that always
provokes an echo.</p>

<p>“Ted was such a funny little fellow when he
was very small,” Nancy told her cousin. “He
used to say he loved to go under bridges,
where he could hear his voice after he was
finished with it.”</p>

<p>“Finished with it?” queried Rosa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
“Yes; that’s the way he used to describe an
echo.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how funny!” yelled Rosa. “Let’s
give a couple of echoes for Ted.”</p>

<p>They shouted again and again, until the
echoes became a mere jumble of sounds.</p>

<p>“I must read Mumsey’s letter,” insisted
Nancy presently. “Just let’s sit in the boat
and&mdash;read it.”</p>

<p>The steamer letter proved the treat it was
bound to be, Nancy hugging every word,
every syllable, while Rosa leaned over, fascinated.</p>

<p>“Your mother is&mdash;wonderful, Nan,” she
said finally. “No wonder you&mdash;you’ve got so
much sense.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” asked Nancy, unwilling to take
that sort of compliment. “No one, not any
of my friends, ever say things like that to me;
I’m so flighty,” she admitted quite frankly.</p>

<p>“But you’re not scrappy like I am,” spoke
Rosa. “I just wonder why I love to&mdash;oppose
folks.” This little sentence sounded tragic
from Rosa’s lips. Her round, dimpily face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
fell into serious lines as she expressed this
query, and even her baby-blue eyes looked far
away where they could see nothing.</p>

<p>“You’re not scrappy,” Nancy felt bound to
defend. “Maybe you just imagine folks are
opposing you,” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“I know they are,” insisted Rosa sadly.</p>

<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<span>MAROONED AT NIGHTFALL</span></h2>


<p>It was Nancy who now felt guilty&mdash;guilty
of arousing in Rosa that queer little spirit of
rebellion which seemed to rule her budding
life.</p>

<p>“But, Rosa,” she argued, quite helplessly,
for Nancy had no illusion about her own weaknesses,
“don’t you think, maybe, you just
imagine a lot of things?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” fired back Rosa.</p>

<p>“No, not that way,” replied Nancy.
“What’s the use of making worries? If you
had a brother like our Ted&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or a sister like Ted has,” put in Rosa good-humoredly.
“I know you hate silly stuff,
Nancy. You wouldn’t let me say that you’ve
done me a lot of good already; but you have.”</p>

<p>“How? Why, Rosa, we hardly know each
other, and I really couldn’t do you good, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
I’m rather&mdash;rather queer, you know. I just
couldn’t&mdash;” Nancy stumbled and paused.</p>

<p>“Pretend,” finished Rosa. “That’s it,
Nancy, you’re just being queer, is the reason.
There’s a name for it but don’t let’s bother
about that. Shall we row out?”</p>

<p>“I love to row,” declared Nancy again, taking
her place at the oars.</p>

<p>“And I hate to,” admitted Rosa, settling
back in the cushions.</p>

<p>“Rowing ought to be good for you,” suggested
Nancy. “Isn’t it queer how we skinnies
always do the things that make us thinner?”</p>

<p>“And we fatties&mdash;” But Rosa’s remark
was cut short by a call; it seemed to come
from the island.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” both girls exclaimed.</p>

<p>They listened.</p>

<p>“It’s coming from No Man’s Land and it’s a
woman’s voice,” declared Rosa.</p>

<p>“Can we row over there?” asked Nancy.
“She’s in distress, surely.”</p>

<p>“Maybe <em>you</em> could, but I can’t row worth a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
cent,” confessed Rosa. “I’ll answer her.”</p>

<p>She again cupped her hands to her mouth
and called the megaphone call.</p>

<p>“Whoo-hoo! Where are&mdash;you!”</p>

<p>“Here! Here!” came a shrill reply. “On
the island! Come&mdash;get&mdash;me!”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to try,” sighed Rosa. “I
suppose it’s some one marooned out there and
naturally afraid of night coming. It might
storm to-night, too.”</p>

<p>Without further ado Nancy turned the boat
and headed for the island. The dot of land
was not more than a dark speck on the sunset-lighted
waters, for although it was late evening,
the glow of a parting day was still gloriously
strewn over the great, broad lake and
mountains, flanking every side of the basin
and adding to its depths. The usual craft
were rather scarce just now, social dinner-times
absorbing the lure of the great Out
Doors.</p>

<p>Valiantly Nancy tugged at her oars, while
Rosa directed verbally and steered at the
helm. The distance was much longer than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
had appeared to be, but after safely passing
Dead Rock and Eagles’ Lair, the little boat
was now bravely skirting the island.</p>

<p>“Here! Here!” called a woman’s voice
shrilly. “Thank the mercies you’ve come! I
thought I was here for the night and I’ve got
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Mrs. Pixley!” exclaimed Rosa.
“So it’s you! However did you get caught
over here?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t&mdash;didn’t get caught at all. It was
that brazen girl&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orilla?” asked Rosa.</p>

<p>“No one else. Just Orilla. The sassy little
thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nancy was just pulling in to land when it
seemed to her that the voice sounded oddly
familiar. Then she caught sight of the excited
woman’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello!” she too exclaimed. “You’re
the lady with the grape juice bottle&mdash;the one
that exploded in the train!” Nancy declared
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Of all things! I want to know! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
you’re the little girl who tried to help me!
Rosalind Fernell, is this girl visiting you?”
demanded she whom Rosa had called Mrs.
Pixley.</p>

<p>“Why, of course. She’s my cousin, Nancy
Brandon from out Boston way. How did <em>you</em>
know her?”</p>

<p>A rather sketchy account of the train incident
was then furnished in a dialogue between
Nancy and Mrs. Pixley, the latter at the same
time gathering up pails and baskets and preparing
to get into the boat.</p>

<p>“I came over here for berries,” she explained.
“I’ve a sick lady who would have
blueberries, and I knew I’d get them here.
Orilla had the launch&mdash;Mr. Cowan’s, you
know, Rosa, and she ran me over here like a
streak. Promised to be back by five but here
it is&mdash;What time is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Nearly nine,” replied Rosa. “What do
you suppose happened to Orilla?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Nothing <em>could</em> happen to her.
I often tell her mother I don’t see what’s going
to become of that girl. Shall I get in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
front? I don’t want to spill them blueberries.
There’s hardly any ripe yet, but Miss Sandford
has been pestering me for some. There,
now I’m all right. Want me to row? It’s
such a mercy you came. No boats came past
the island&mdash;hardly any, and I’m hoarse from
shoutin’. Here, young lady, give me them
oars. You’re tuckered out,” and still talking
Mrs. Pixley took Nancy’s place, not against
Nancy’s will, either.</p>

<p>“But Orilla,” Rosa said again. “I haven’t
seen Cowan’s launch out this afternoon. And
she always comes by our dock when she has
that out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother with that girl, Rosalind,”
cautioned Mrs. Pixley. “She’s flighty. Never
no telling what she’s going to do next&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But she’s awfully smart,” interrupted
Rosa.</p>

<p>“In some ways, but that don’t make her
wise.” Mrs. Pixley was an expert at the oars
as well as being a fluent talker. Nancy
watched and listened, with admiration and
with interest.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in at your place, Rosalind,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the woman, “and get a ride down the
road. Lots of cars running down the hill at
this time of night. And if you see Orilla
Rigney you can tell her for me, she’ll not get
another drop of milk at my place. To play
me such a trick!” Mrs. Pixley’s indignation
almost interfered with her talking, but not
quite.</p>

<p>“Just imagine you knowing Mrs. Pixley,
Nancy,” Rosalind managed to remark as they
pulled in.</p>

<p>“Yes, just imagine!” repeated the woman
before Nancy could speak. “Well, if you ever
saw that grape juice fly, Rosalind, you’d understand
how well <em>I</em> got acquainted on that
car!”</p>

<p>“How funny!” persisted Rosa. “Did it
hurt anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly anyone, but a lot of things,”
laughed the woman. “I’ll never forget that
fat man’s shirt front! Looked like my log-cabin
quilt. And the lady with the yellow
hair&mdash;remember her, Nancy? How it turned
lavender?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
“Indeed I do; she looked like someone made
up for a masquerade&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d been there!” sighed Rose, interrupting
Nancy. “But I never happen to
be around when that sort of lark is on. Well,
here we are. All ashore who’s going ashore!”
she chanted. “And Mrs. Pixley, you can row
almost as well as Nancy.”</p>

<p>This compliment was accepted with another
flood of words from Mrs. Pixley. When all
were again safely landed at the Fernell dock,
the queer woman took herself off without any
unnecessary delay. She had talked of her
experiences on the train when Nancy had
witnessed the grape juice explosion, she had
talked of and against Orilla Rigney, she had
talked of the unreasonable “lady customer”
who had insisted upon early blueberries, and
Nancy wondered, as she listened to her repeat
her thanks and her goodnights, if Mrs. Pixley
really ever stopped talking.</p>

<p>But this was not the most interesting point
in the little adventure. Nancy’s wonderment
centered more about the connection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Orilla with the affair. Mrs. Pixley seemed
one more person who disliked that girl, and
Nancy said so to Rosa.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it dreadful of Orilla not to go back
for her?” she said, when she and Rosa tied up
the boat.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have killed old Pixley to stay
on the island all night,” defended Rosa.
“Maybe it would have cooled off her gabbing.”</p>

<p>Nancy had no desire to start a fresh argument.
So she did not press the subject further,
but she wondered when this person of
mystery would make her appearance in Rosa’s
home. That the passage for Europe of Mr.
and Mrs. Fernell, now only a few hours off,
would precipitate the invasion of Orilla,
seemed rather too sure a guess for Nancy, for
she dreaded its realization. She didn’t want
anything to do with the Rigney girl, and she
hoped Rosa would not now find her companionship
desirable.</p>

<p>For in Nancy’s mind was stored the vivid
remembrance of Rosa’s accident in the woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
This she could not help attributing to Orilla’s
queer influence, and she hoped that the painful
affair had been a good lesson to Rosa.</p>

<p>“Afraid of the dark?” Rosa asked, as the
last rays of light were caught up in the receding
sky.</p>

<p>“No, not of the dark,” replied Nancy, trying
again the knot with which she fastened the
boat. “But it certainly is lonely out here,
with all that water to run into if anyone
chases us,” she added, jokingly.</p>

<p>“You bet!” agreed Rosa. “That’s one
thing we must never try to do; we must not
try to run across that lake, for it’s awfully
wet.”</p>

<p>“Is that a boat I hear? Maybe it’s Orilla,”
suggested Nancy, listening to the distant purr
of a motor boat.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it is,” replied Rosa.
“You see, she keeps awfully busy, and I suppose
it didn’t worry her any to leave poor
Pixley to swim ashore.”</p>

<p>“What a very odd girl she must be,” continued
Nancy, almost against her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
“Perhaps she is, but then&mdash;oh, well, don’t
let’s bother about her. Dad is sure to be
watching the moon rise from the East porch,”
said Rosa, as they started back toward the
house. “Let’s go talk to him.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps he and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty will be bossing the packing,”
interrupted Rosa, anticipating the words of
Nancy’s objections. “Come on. I’m going
to miss dad and I want to be with him all I
can&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>“Then <em>you</em> go talk to him, Rosa,” urged
Nancy, considerately. “I’ve got some things
to do. You won’t mind. You see, I must
write mother at once, so that she’ll get it almost
as soon as she reaches London.”</p>

<p>“Give her my love,” said Rosa, as the
cousins parted on the porch.</p>

<p>On the little table in her room Nancy found
a gift from Betty, a beautiful rainbow chiffon
scarf, and also a big box of candy from her
Uncle Frederic. She loved the scarf; it was
beautiful, and would blend with any and every
costume. The candy, of course, was equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
welcome, for she had no doubt that her uncle
himself had thought of it.</p>

<p>Standing before the broad mirror of her
dresser she tried on the scarf. Her simple
powder-blue dress was made much more attractive
beneath its colorful folds, and it delighted
Nancy to vision its possibilities as an
adjunct to her limited outfit. It would be
lovely over her apple green&mdash;the black shadows
in it would be wonderful over green, she
reflected, and her gray dress&mdash;the one she
wanted so much and her mother objected to
because of its somberness&mdash;that would be
perfect with the rainbow scarf.</p>

<p>Throwing the filmy ends first over one
shoulder and then over the other, stepping
this way and that to suit the pose and get just
the correct lighting on the scarf, Nancy was
quite unconscious of a light step approaching
her open door.</p>

<p>Then, as she turned once more to try just
one more swing of the silken tie, she found
herself facing the smiling Lady Betty.</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span>TRYING ON IDEALISM</span></h2>


<p>Fully expecting Mrs. Frederic Fernell to
pour into her ears the story of Rosa’s rebellious
habits, with the intention of soliciting
Nancy’s aid toward their correction, Nancy
instantly assumed the defensive. She did not
come out to New Hampshire to reform Rosalind
Fernell, and besides that, she was not
ready to admit that Rosa needed reforming.</p>

<p>All of which really marked Nancy’s sincerity,
for she was by no means a “poser.”
She knew she had failings herself, so why
should not Rosa have some? Because each
differed in her weakness, did that make either
less weak or less troublesome? Not according
to Nancy’s reasoning, at any rate.</p>

<p>The figure floating into her room, as usual
sent a dainty fragrance on ahead.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you like your scarf, dear,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Betty, sinking into the nearest chair, “and I
see you do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I love it,” said Nancy, forgetting
everything else but her gratitude. “Thank
you so much for giving it to me&mdash;Betty.”
She always paused before using the name without
any other distinguishing mark of respect.</p>

<p>“I knew it would match you&mdash;you are so
varied in your own tones. Well, my dear, I
do so want you to have a lovely time with
Rosa this summer, that I just stepped in to
assure you of that. Your Uncle Frederic and
I are most anxious to have both of you enjoy
yourselves. To help you to do so, we have
made some new plans.” The chair with the
parrot cushion suited Betty best, so she sank
into that as gracefully as usual.</p>

<p>Nancy caressed the playful scarf she still
held about her shoulders and she, also, sat
down. New plans! She hoped they would
not be so very different, for she was only now
becoming acquainted at Fernlode, and rather
dreaded the unusual.</p>

<p>“It can be terribly dull here,” pursued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
lady, “and for two young girls especially. So
I have coaxed my husband to allow Rosa and
you to attend little affairs at our hotel&mdash;properly
chaperoned, of course,” she concluded.</p>

<p>“At the Sunset Hotel?” queried Nancy, a
little uneasily. She had no clothes suitable
for such functions, was what she instantly
thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear. You see, your Uncle Frederic
has implicit faith in the good judgment of
our friends the Durands, and they will go with
you&mdash;they always do attend the Sunset,”
said Lady Betty.</p>

<p>“That’s lovely, of course,” faltered Nancy,
“but mother had no idea&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand, dear child,” interrupted the
little queen in her lace robes in the big chair.
“You shall need pretty things, and I just <em>love</em>
to buy them, so I’ve had a box sent in to you.
You see, Rosa,” as Nancy was attempting to
speak, “has an idea no one can buy anything
for <em>her</em>. She is stout, but young enough to
grow thin,” said the remote step-mother,
“yet, I can’t interfere with Rosa. It just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
makes her more furious.”</p>

<p>“It’s lovely of you to bother with me,
Betty, and I do like pretty things. But I
hate to give you so much bother.” Nancy
felt very stupid making such commonplace
thanks. Ted would have choked to listen to
that foolish speech. Was Betty going to
avoid the troublesome subject of Rosa’s tempers?
Was Nancy going to escape the tactful
lecture she had felt sure of receiving?</p>

<p>“If things have to be altered Margot will
attend to that,” went on the Lady Betty,
“and you just <em>wear</em> everything. That’s what
they’re for. Have a good time and grow fat!
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if some little fairy
took from Rosa what she gave to you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we both could afford at least
some of that sort of change,” said Nancy,
warming up to Betty’s pleasantries. “But if
I had just known what clothes I should have
needed, I am sure I would have brought them
along.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’m glad you didn’t know. Otherwise
I should have missed all the fun of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
shopping tour. Folks think me very vain, I
know,” admitted the pretty Mrs. Fernell,
“but I do <em>love</em> beautiful things. I’d like to
dress a whole army of girls&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But not like soldiers,” ventured Nancy.</p>

<p>“Like the prettiest soldiers in all ages&mdash;the
girls who fight the battles of wanting things
they deserve, yet cannot always have.” In
this rather confused speech, even Nancy could
see that Betty was trying to avoid reference
to her own (Nancy’s) possible needs.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, indeed,” said Nancy
quietly.</p>

<p>“Not really. Because, you see, my dear, I
have given myself so much pleasure. But I
hope things will fit and that you will like&mdash;most
of them.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure to,” declared Nancy. Then as
Betty stood up she asked:</p>

<p>“Isn’t anything in the box for Rosa? If I
see that she likes anything may I say you
would like her to have it?”</p>

<p>“You clever child!” laughed the lady, and
Nancy’s admiration for her charms increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
with the flow of silvery sounds. “You are
really an idealist; you must have everything
ideally arranged,” she finished.</p>

<p>“But I am not, really,” protested Nancy,
now actually sensing the dreaded lecture.</p>

<p>Nancy felt rather foolish, as any girl would,
in spite of the way Betty complimented her,
for back of it all she was sure, quite positive
the real point of the talk lay in the need of
Rosa for healthy companionship. Not that
Nancy wasn’t grateful for the confidence and
for the gifts, but because she really wasn’t “an
old lady” and hated anything that made her
feel like one.</p>

<p>“Rosa is with her daddy now, so I’m stealing
this little chat with you,” was Mrs. Fernell’s
next remark. “I do love Rosa&mdash;all our
family always loved her mother,” said Betty,
much to Nancy’s surprise. “My sister was
Katherine’s school chum, and that’s how Fred
and I became acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Nancy, the single syllable
embodying her surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes.” A deep sigh from Betty was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
significant. “But Rosa has proved a problem.
She resents, it seems, my marrying her father,
although I have tried quietly to show her how
little I intend to interfere with her life.”</p>

<p>She knew it would come; it just had to, and
she couldn’t have expected to escape it, although
at the moment Nancy hated her position
as confidante, against her most loyal
feelings for Rosa. That was just it; she
couldn’t escape it. Presently her care of Rosa
would be thrust at her, just as if she had been
some kind of nurse.</p>

<p>“It will work out all right; I’m sure, however,”
went on the pretty one, “if only we can
keep Rosa away from certain influences. You
see, Nancy, this is an unpleasant topic for me,
naturally,” and the soft voice fell into deep
blue velvet tones, “but as I am going away,
and as I really do stand very close to Rosalind,
I feel you should understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was all Nancy could think of saying.</p>

<p>“There was a girl here&mdash;you have probably
heard of her, Orilla Rigney,” began Mrs.
Fernell again, although she was still standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
“and she is responsible for much of Rosa’s
aggressiveness. You see, she and her mother
lived here as sort of care-takers, and your
Uncle Frederic was so kind to them they felt
the place was and should be their home. The
girl has tried to injure me ever since I came
here. As if I could have anything in common
with them.” Here Mrs. Fernell paused, haughtily.
“Unfortunately she has gotten into
Rosa’s confidence, with a lot of silly nonsense,”
she continued after a moment. “Well,
Nancy, you see I am piling troubles upon your
head, but Rosa is a great baby in spite of her
decided ways. So just have a good time,
wear the pretty clothes, and when you write
to your mother tell her we hope to find her in
the big country across the water. Frederic
Fernell thinks his sister is just one woman
without equal, and I feel I know her through
his admiration and love&mdash;”</p>

<p>This sudden turn in the glimpse of Betty’s
character left Nancy simply gasping with surprise.
She wasn’t at all the foolish, pretty
doll she had been pictured, she <em>did</em> love Rosa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and Rosa was simply crazy to be so opposed
to her, thought Nancy.</p>

<p>One thing was certain, however, nobody,
just nobody, had a good word for Orilla.
Jealousy is an awful thing, Nancy reflected,
for even in her short life she had heard of its
offences and, of course, Orilla was jealous.</p>

<p>Before Rosa returned from her confab with
her father and before Lady Betty was back in
her own room, Nancy had again fallen into
speculation as to when, where and how she
would actually meet Orilla.</p>

<p>“When the coast is clear,” she promptly
decided. “When the folks are gone and Rosa
is alone. But <em>I’ll</em> be here,” decided Nancy,
not realizing how promptly she was espousing
the cause she had been so determined to ignore.</p>

<p>Then a thumping and pouncing through the
hall announced the arrival of Rosa. She was
calling to Nancy, shouting, yelling without
even expecting or even giving Nancy the
slightest chance of replying.</p>

<p>“What do you know! What do you know!”
she sang out joyously. “We’re going to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
hotel! Down to Sunset! Nancy Brandon,
what a lark! In the dark! Let us park!”
she went on foolishly, trying to rhyme words
to suit her caprice. “If you hadn’t come, of
course,” she brought her voice down a few
keys but not quite to dead center, “I shouldn’t
have been allowed that. Betty has fallen in
love with you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Rosa,” said Nancy quite
sagely. “It’s all on your account and you’re
a perfect goose not to know that she is in love
with <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“With me! Fat, furious me! With the
bad tempered manners, and badness cropping
out all over me!” scoffed Rosa.</p>

<p>“Like the bad boy in the play who was
always scared to death of a pop gun. Rosa,
you are not a very good actress,” laughed
Nancy, and in that little speech she showed
Rosa the way that she, at least, regarded her
faults. They were a pose, a manner put on to
ward off sympathy. And Rosa herself could
not hate sympathy more than did Nancy.</p>

<p>They talked over the prospects of that summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
hotel until it would seem all the summer’s
fun and good times were dependent upon it.
Rosa just couldn’t wait to see what Betty was
sending in from Boston in the box, which
Nancy had tactfully said was “for us,” and it
was then, just as Betty had hinted, that Rosa
forgot her rebel pose, for she actually expressed
great hopes of what might be in that box for
<em>her</em>!</p>

<p>“I have to do everything so quietly, so as
not to arouse her suspicion,” Betty had said.
And now Nancy was hoping that she too would
be able to follow that policy.</p>

<p>Nancy Brandon might indeed be an idealist,
but she was blissfully ignorant of possessing
any such subtle quality.</p>

<h2><a name="xii" id="xii"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span>WOODLAND RAMBLES</span></h2>


<p>The next day went by in a whirl. After
seeing the folks off for Europe&mdash;Nancy and
Rosa went over to Mount Major, where Mr.
and Mrs. Fernell took the New York train&mdash;the
remaining hours seemed too few in which
to crowd all the things Rosa had planned to do.</p>

<p>The injured foot was all but forgotten.
Never was a girl livelier than Rosa, more enthusiastic
nor more expectant&mdash;for the great
times ahead. But through all her plans, it
seemed to Nancy, a vein of mystery ran. For
instance, she would talk about losing weight,
exercising, dieting and go over the entire
formula, when suddenly she would stop short,
maybe put her finger to her lips and do something
to indicate secrecy.</p>

<p>“It’s all planned and plotted,” she declared,
when she finally did agree to take a little walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
through the special fern path from which the
place had received its name, “and won’t daddy
and Betty be surprised?”</p>

<p>“What makes you so sure?” asked Nancy.
“How ever can you tell that you will lose
pounds and pounds?”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>positive</em>,” replied Rosa. “And I just
dream of it all the time. Haven’t you ever
had that sort of dream?”</p>

<p>“The silly kind? Surely. I had one special
pet&mdash;and I’m afraid I haven’t banished it
yet,” admitted Nancy. “I always wanted to
wake up with light golden curls and heavenly
blue eyes.”</p>

<p>The shout with which Rosa replied to this
must have disturbed every pixy in the woods,
for she simply roared!</p>

<p>“And you think <em>that</em> would make you
happy! Why, I have blue eyes and curls,
and my hair was golden&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you are very pretty!”</p>

<p>“Nancy&mdash;Antoinette Brandon!”</p>

<p>“I mean it. You are!”</p>

<p>“Fat me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
“You don’t have to stay fat!”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>not</em> going to!”</p>

<p>“Rosa&mdash;Rosalind Fernell!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Please tell me what you mean.”</p>

<p>“By getting thin?”</p>

<p>“No. How are you going to get thin?”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Rosa swung herself around until
she touched the little white birch tree with her
finger tips. “You just wait and see!”</p>

<p>“I think that’s rather mean.” Nancy also
swung herself around but not in Rosa’s direction.
“I do hope you are not going to do anything
foolish.”</p>

<p>“That depends. <em>Margot</em> thinks everything
I do is foolish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I don’t mean that, Rosa,”
Nancy answered quickly. “But, you see,
with the folks away we’ve got to be rather&mdash;cautious.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t preach.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how. Ted says I preach
like the umpire at a ball game.”</p>

<p>“You were going to show me his funny letter,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
put in Rosa, her eagerness to change the
subject not even thinly disguised. “I know
you have a whole batch of them, too. You
know, Dell is just crazy about that sort of
thing. She wants to teach kindergarten.
Just imagine!”</p>

<p>“She’s very intelligent,” said Nancy, falling
back into her own way of saying things which
had ever been a part of her home life.
“Mother always says we can tell folks by the
things they prefer, rather than by the company
they keep.”</p>

<p>“You’re over my head, Nancy,” laughed
Rosa. “But if that’s true I must be a spiritual
skeleton, for I love&mdash;thin folks.” Impulsively
Rosa had thrown her arms around
Nancy, and just as impulsively Nancy had
thrown her arms around Rosa, until presently
they were dancing through the woods like a
couple of sprites&mdash;even if Rosa was a trifle
out of spritely proportion.</p>

<p>They sang snatches of songs, they tried out
different steps and were as free as the air about
them; until they heard something queer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“What’s that?” Nancy asked the question
first.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” replied Rosa.</p>

<p>“Sounds like someone groaning.”</p>

<p>“A man, don’t you think?” Rosa’s voice
had dwindled to a whisper.</p>

<p>Again came the noise interrupting their
questions. This time there was no mistaking
it. Someone was groaning.</p>

<p>“Let’s run back; we’re away out in Baker’s
Woods,” said Rosa with deep concern. “And
there’s the road. We’ll take that,” at which
both girls turned to the well beaten path.</p>

<p>“Halt!” came the command. “Right about
face!”</p>

<p>“Garry Durand!” exclaimed Rosa. “You
mean thing!”</p>

<p>“Not to be an old tramp or something?”
jeered the boy, who had stepped out into
their path and was enjoying the little fright
he had given them. “I suppose,” he went
on, “you are disappointed. A real bandit
would have been more fun.”</p>

<p>“Now, Gar,” scolded Rosa, “you know a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
lot better than that. We were just wondering
where you and Dell had been keeping
yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Like fun you were, just wondering. We’ve
been watching you dance. What was that?
A new one?”</p>

<p>“We?” queried Rosa.</p>

<p>“Yes. Come on, Paul; get introduced.”</p>

<p>At this there stepped from behind a big
tree, another young man&mdash;no doubt Paul.</p>

<p>“This is Paul Randolph,” said Gar, “Miss
Brandon and the famous Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Rosa cut that short. “The idea,” she
protested, “of you peeping.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t, really,” defended Paul. “We
just came along. Our car went dry and we
were walking back.”</p>

<p>“Then, we’ll forgive you,” Nancy managed
to say. She was losing the natural self-consciousness
which had at first been difficult to
overcome. Coming from the home of her
devoted mother and darling Ted into the confused
surroundings of Rosa, this was easy to
understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
As she spoke Paul stepped up to her, and
they started off in the direction of home.
Rosa was ahead with Gar and she, it appeared,
was not in agreement with him. He
argued and she protested.</p>

<p>Instantly his remark about Nancy coming
just in time to save Rosa from some mysterious
danger, flitted back into Nancy’s mind.
It had been said at their very first meeting,
but as time wore on, many other things appeared
to make it seem important, and, of
course, it was connected with Orilla. Now,
Nancy could scarcely keep track of what Paul
was saying, because of the distraction ahead
with Rosa and Gar.</p>

<p>“I tell you flatly I won’t!” Gar broke out
once just as Rosa, smiling, grabbed his arm
and turned the remark into a joke. But as
he turned around facing Nancy and Paul, his
expression flatly belied Rosa’s attempt.</p>

<p>“Did you hear about the fun we are going
to have at Sunset?” Rosa asked Paul.</p>

<p>“Hear about the <em>fun</em> you are <em>going</em> to have?”
he teased. “How could we?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
“Oh, you know what I mean,” pouted
Rosa. “We are going to the dances.”</p>

<p>“So are we,” said Paul gallantly, “so I suppose
that’s hearing about the fun we are <em>all</em>
going to have.”</p>

<p>“They have swell music,” put in Gar. “The
best banjoist in Boston is with that outfit.”</p>

<p>“But really it isn’t Sunset that’s so attractive,
but getting out,” explained Rosa.
“You see, I’ve been rather tied to the apron
string of Margot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lovely long string,” said Paul gaily,
“judging from Gar’s accounts.”</p>

<p>“Has he been giving away my secrets?”
asked Rosa, winking at Nancy and attempting
to strike Gar.</p>

<p>“Better be careful,” cautioned Nancy, “or
you’ll give them away yourself, Rosa. That’s
the worst of having secrets; they’re so tricky.”</p>

<p>“Now we’re getting interesting,” remarked
Paul. “Go ahead, Nancy. Give us your idea
of&mdash;secrets.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she hasn’t any,” put in Rosa, rather
flustered. “That is, she hasn’t any of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
kind; she doesn’t have to.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at that except Rosa,
and even to Paul Randolph, the stranger,
Rosa’s uneasiness must have been evident.
Quickly deciding to save her cousin from
further embarrassment, Nancy broke into a
lively talk about New Hampshire, comparing
it with Massachusetts, and insisting that the
big, measureless lake, with mountains all
around it, and according to tradition with
mountains hidden in its depth, was no more
scenically beautiful than many another less
famous and much smaller lake in the sister
state.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you scenery,” declared Gar in
worthy defense of his adopted territory.
“Over among those hills there’s everything
you could imagine in the way of rocks and
lands and vegetation&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Except pretty wild flowers,” cut in Nancy.
“And you don’t even have very pretty ferns.”</p>

<p>Whereat a general study in the ferns all
around them was begun. The little by-play
helped to make talk and the interest shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
was surely genuine, although occasionally
Rosa would step aside with Gar and insist
upon whispering to him. Nancy tried to keep
up her contention that New Hampshire ferns
were not as lacy as those of Massachusetts,
but the argument going on between Rosa and
Gar was hard to close her ears to.</p>

<p>“Say!” called out Paul suddenly, kicking
over a big bunch of “umbrella fungus,”
“what’s going on between you two anyway?
Don’t you want an umpire?”</p>

<p>“No,” fired back Gar, “a referee would be
better. Rosa thinks because I’m an old
friend she can get me into her sort of scrapes.
You’ve no idea, Nancy,” he sighed playfully,
“how many scrapes Rosa <em>can</em> get into.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think you’re smart, don’t you?”
snapped Rosa, childishly. “Just because&mdash;because
I happen to have different plans from
yours, Gar.”</p>

<p>“But we’re helpless, you know, Rosa,”
Nancy hurried to say. “We only got permission
to go out without Margot, on condition
that we would be very good and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
everything that Dell and Gar wanted us to
do.”</p>

<p>“As if I intend to follow that silly stuff,”
flung back Rosa, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” drawled Gar elaborately,
as if he were being very much offended.
“Don’t worry about us. We can find plenty
to do without&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Peace! Peace!” chanted Paul, as if fearful
that the fun might result otherwise. “We
might want an umpire or even a referee, but
we don’t want a policeman.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about it?” asked Gar, turning
so suddenly to another trend of thought that
Nancy didn’t even guess what he meant. “Do
we go to the dance to-night or don’t we?”</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” declared Rosa, promptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know you can if you want to,
Rose,” the boy urged, “and it’s going to be a
big time.”</p>

<p>“But we really don’t take part in the dance,
do we?” queried Nancy, just a little timidly,
for she was not yet old enough to go to dances.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, lamb,” said Rosa, facetiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
“even the very babes dance at summer
hotels early in the evening. Later, of course,
the grown-ups own the floor. What we want
to see is the masquerade, the follies, and all
the stunts they get up. They’re fun!” she
admitted, thus agreeing with Gar, who wanted
to go to an affair that evening.</p>

<p>They were back to the porch of the big
house now, and although Rosa pressed the
boys to sit on the bench awhile, they politely
declined, declaring they would presently have
to go back to town for the delayed car.</p>

<p>Nancy was interested in Paul; it was so easy
to talk to him&mdash;which fact Rosa presently
explained.</p>

<p>“That’s because he’s so awfully smart,”
she said when Nancy remarked how much she
liked him. “He’s all ready for the M. I. T.
I heard Gar say so.”</p>

<p>“The Massachusetts Institute of Technology,”
amplified Nancy, “and he seems
only like a high school boy.”</p>

<p>“Just being smart does it,” said Rosa cryptically.
“One has either to be smart or handsome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and Paul is going to be both.”</p>

<p>Margot came hurriedly out and interrupted
them.</p>

<p>“I want to see you alone, Rosalind,” she
said, so severely that Nancy was glad to run
off to her room and leave Rosa with her judge.
She wondered what could be the matter that
Margot would use such a tone, and look so
indignantly at Rose.</p>

<p>“All right, Maggie,” was all that Rosa said
in reply to the peremptory summons.</p>

<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span>A PARTY CAPE OF BLUE</span></h2>


<p>It was two days later that the box of pretty
things arrived from Boston. Nancy was glad
that it had been addressed to Mrs. Frederic
Fernell, for had her name been upon it, even
under the other, she would not have known
how to explain to Rosa.</p>

<p>And its coming brought a welcome relief in
the feud which seemed to exist between Margot
and Rosa, consequent upon that little
private interview which had occurred after
the walk in the woods.</p>

<p>Rosa had been sullen almost to the point of
rudeness, but by this time Nancy had learned
to regard her whims as mere childishness, a
determination not “to give in” which was
about as strong as good pie crust&mdash;and just
as easily broken.</p>

<p>That Rosa’s running off without giving an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
account of her business was the real cause of
Margot’s misgivings, Nancy was now well
aware, for Rosa would slip away without any
explanation, about every time she found the
chance of getting a ride into town without
taking her own car, her own chauffeur, Margot
or even Nancy.</p>

<p>At first this hurt Nancy’s feelings. She was
plainly being slighted. When Dell, Gar and
Paul would come over or phone over for the
girls to go off to see a tennis match, go swimming
in the best part of the lake, which was
some little distance from their cottages, or
even go berrying, which was the thing Nancy
best liked to do&mdash;to all or any of this Rosa
would very likely find an excuse. And then,
when some obscure person with a little flivver
would happen along, she would suddenly remember
something very important to be procured,
and dash off.</p>

<p>Nancy was forming her own opinions of
these unexplained flights. She noticed the
messages that preceded them, she noticed
Rosa trying to gather a certain amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
money, even asking Nancy to lend her a few
dollars until she could cash her allowance, and
she noticed more than any of these unfavorable
symptoms, that Rosa had headaches,
real severe headaches that made her cheeks
burn, her eyes smart and feel altogether miserable&mdash;these
always followed one of the flurried
trips to town.</p>

<p>The advent of the box of pretty things was,
therefore, a most welcome diversion, and now
as Nancy and Rosa both tore off the wrappings,
they chuckled merrily over what they
hoped would be the contents.</p>

<p>“You must choose first,” said Rosa generously.
“You may have just whatever you
like best.”</p>

<p>Nancy was not sure that she would do this,
and she felt almost guilty in her deception, for
Mrs. Betty had very plainly said that the box
was to be for Nancy.</p>

<p>Presently the papers had all been removed,
the tissues torn apart, and there was then revealed
such a gorgeous display of lovely,
colorful things, that Rosa and Nancy fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
danced in delight over them.</p>

<p>“You take this,” pressed Rosa. And then:
“Oh, it must be for you, for it’s too tiny for
me.” The article just referred to was a
straight-line dress of tub silk, in a variegated
stripe that was charming. Nancy took it,
held it up and said how lovely she thought it
was.</p>

<p>“And these undies,” exclaimed Rosa again.
“Betty must have bought those for you,” as
she passed over the dainty silk under things,
“because I wear a special kind. These are
lovely, though. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are be-u-tee-ful!” declared Nancy.
“Hasn’t Betty wonderful taste?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what she has the very most of&mdash;taste,”
said Rosa a little critically. “But
then, she needs it. How would she look without
it? Oh, see here!” as a little sport hat
was dug out of its wrappings. “Now, someone
has to have her hair bobbed,” and she
attempted to put the hat on her head. It
stood up on top, as hats used to when women
wore full skirts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
The girls went into gales of laughter at the
effect. Then Nancy tried on the yellow felt
hat, and, of course, it fitted her.</p>

<p>“For you again,” declared Rosa, still happily
expectant herself.</p>

<p>Then there was a darling little party dress of
black roses in georgette, over yellow. This,
obviously, was also for Nancy, until she began
to feel embarrassed that nothing of Rosa’s
size was forthcoming.</p>

<p>Finally Rosa held up something blue. It
was a cape&mdash;a lovely soft, fluffy cape of blue
peach-blow cloth, trimmed with white fur.</p>

<p>“Oh! How darling!” both girls exclaimed
in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>It was lovely. Almost like a piece of blue
sky with a little fleecy cloud of white fur at
the neck. Each of the girls held it; they
fondled it, caressed it. Both of them loved
it, it would fit both. Rosa decided she could
wear <em>that</em>, and Nancy secretly tried to keep
back the wish that she herself might have it.</p>

<p>She had always dreamed of just such a cape
as that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
“It goes beautifully with my shade of hair,
doesn’t it,” Rosa prattled. “And I adore
that tone of blue. Oh, Nan, you can have
everything else, but I’m so glad Betty thought
to get this for me! I’m going to love her for
it. Maybe I have been mean, as you say,
Nan, and maybe Betty does love me, after all.”
And thereat the cape became the property of
Rosa, while poor, disappointed Nancy applauded.</p>

<p>If ever a girl’s heart can suddenly turn to
ice and then try to choke her, that seemed to
be what was happening just then to Nancy.</p>

<p>That cape! That precious, adorable cape,
that she had always secretly dreamed of and
that she could have made such wonderful use
of! It was to her like a picture from her first
fairy book.</p>

<p>Her mother or even Miss Manners (the
loving “Manny” who was away off this summer)
could have made dresses, pretty under
things, and perhaps any of the other lovely
articles, but a peach-blow cape, trimmed with
white fur, seemed beyond the reach forever
of poor Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
“Don’t you love it?” persisted Rosa, flirting
around the glorious blue wings, like a great
live bird.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Nancy, too truthfully.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry now that we didn’t plan to go
down to the hotel to-night. I can’t rest until
I show this off. Not that I haven’t a pretty
party cape, for I have. Have you one,
Nancy?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” faltered Nancy. “I’ve
never needed one.”</p>

<p>“Then, you can have my red one. It will
look stunning on you with your dark hair.
It’s called love-apple, that’s tomato red, you
know,” explained Rosa, still flirting with the
lovely new mantle.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Rosa, but I really don’t go
to parties yet, you know,” replied Nancy.
She never cared for red in coats or capes,
especially tomato red.</p>

<p>“It’s quite gorgeous, with chiffon fliers, like
wings when you walk. I’m sure none of your
friends could have anything more elaborate&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, Rosa,” interrupted Nancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
“I couldn’t wear things as elaborate as yours.
They would look just as if you had given them
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if you feel that way about it;
all right,” replied the cousin a little stiffly.
And that ended the discussion upon capes.</p>

<p>Somehow the joy that came in the box had
exploded like a toy balloon, but Nancy tried
to make herself think of the importance of
Rosa’s changed attitude toward Betty.</p>

<p>“If the cape does that,” she prompted herself,
“surely I can give it up.”</p>

<p>Still, she could not forget how much she
would have loved to own it. And it really was
hers.</p>

<p>Hours passed bringing a keen sense of loneliness
to Nancy. She wasn’t having much
fun&mdash;this sort of life, although it included so
much that she could not have had at home,
also lacked much that she would have had.</p>

<p>Romping about freely with her girl friends
in the little summer colonies, doing unusual
things, some of which had turned out wonderfully
important for mere girls to accomplish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and, above all, that surrounding of loved
ones&mdash;these were the things and conditions
that Nancy missed.</p>

<p>Not that she didn’t love Rosa, for she really
did, but because Rosa was so very hard to
understand, and was apt to do almost anything
reckless, foolish and even risky.</p>

<p>Pitying herself a little, Nancy gave in to
her homesickness. She refused to go over to
Durand’s with Rosa after dinner, she refused
to take a walk with the suspecting Margot,
who must have understood the signs she could
not have helped noticing about Nancy, she
even refused to listen to the radio, and decided
to go to her own room&mdash;and read.</p>

<p>Passing Rosa’s room she saw the precious
blue cape thrown carelessly over a chair. The
sight of it brought on a new fit of bitterness,
and she dashed into the room, grabbed up the
cape, hugged it, as if it were her own, then
threw it swiftly over her shoulders.</p>

<p>There was no one in that part of the house.
Rosa had gone over to Durand’s and Nancy
felt free to indulge in the coveted joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
It was lovely! She stood under the big
soft lights and gazed in the broad mirror,
spellbound.</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” she whispered, “and I’ll always
make believe I’m wearing it.”</p>

<p>Then came the test&mdash;Ted’s test.</p>

<p>Glad or sorry? Was she honestly, truly
glad or sorry that she had not told Rosa all
that Betty had told her about the contents of
that box?</p>

<p>Rosa felt so kindly now toward Betty, and
Betty would have bought her any sort of a
cape she had wished for, could she have only
known!</p>

<p>Again she whirled around and hugged
closer the soft, white fur collar.</p>

<p>Then she heard a step, a very light step,
and turning quickly, she found herself facing
Orilla Rigney!</p>

<h2><a name="xiv" id="xiv"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span>THE SPY</span></h2>


<p>The strange girl’s vivid hair seemed ready
to ignite, it was so blazingly red! Her eyes, a
queer green, glared at the frightened Nancy,
and altogether the intruder’s attitude was one
of defiance and challenge.</p>

<p>“Humph!” she sniffed. “So this is why
you don’t go out with Rosa; you like trying
on her clothes when no one’s around!”</p>

<p>Nancy flushed scarlet. So sudden had
come the accusation, and perhaps because of
her secret state of mind concerning the party
cape, that she felt like one struck down by an
enemy. Somehow the other girl seemed to
tower above her, although Nancy was quite
tall. The glare of those malicious green eyes
seemed to take root in Nancy’s own, and
above all that red hair&mdash;yet Nancy had previously
always loved red hair!</p>

<p>For some moments she did not attempt to
reply to the cruel accusation. Then her defense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
flashed back, true to her instincts of
high-born honesty.</p>

<p>“I have a perfect right to try on my cousin’s
things if I wish,” she said loftily. “But what
right have <em>you</em> here?”</p>

<p>“Keep your voice down,” demanded the
other in angry but subdued tones. “There’s
no need to get the house dogs after us.”</p>

<p>“House dogs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that old Margot&mdash;don’t know why
they didn’t call her Magot,” scolded the girl,
“she’s more like a watch dog than a woman.
But I’m in a hurry. You needn’t mind mentioning
my call,” she sneered, “and then, if
I’m sure of that, I won’t bother telling Rosa
about your&mdash;party!”</p>

<p>The inference was so contemptible that
Nancy shrank away instinctively. She had
already carefully placed the innocent cape
back on its chair, and was ready to lower the
lights, but this last act she deferred. She
felt safer with that high-strung creature under
good, clear lights, at least.</p>

<p>But somehow as she looked at her, the
subtle danger of Orilla’s secret meetings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Rosa flooded into Nancy’s mind. For her,
Nancy, to make an active enemy of Orilla
would surely mean that much more danger to
Rosa, whereas any possible compromise might
at least insure Nancy some knowledge of the
other girl’s affairs.</p>

<p>She was thinking fast. Not that the term
idealist (applied to her by Betty) in any way
entered into her reasoning, but simply because
she was Nancy of the disciplined mind,
taught to think twice when in any serious
predicament. And more than that, she had
been cautioned by her mother, always to put
down the proud spirit of revenge and in its
place to plant courage. Courage to do that
which was hardest, as it would invariably
prove to be that which was best.</p>

<p>To understand Nancy as she was acting
now, it is necessary to understand all this,
although to her it was merely doing the thing
that seemed best.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” she said very slowly, “that
you do not want Rosa to know you have been
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” snapped the girl, “just like you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
don’t want her to know <em>you’ve</em> been here.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t care; why should I?” Nancy
could not help that flare of defiance.</p>

<p>“You were trying on her new clothes,
weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong about that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to sneak, I’m in a hurry. Is it
a bargain or isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What?” blurted Nancy, now a little bit
frightened lest her chance to help Rosa might
suddenly vanish.</p>

<p>“You keep your mouth shut and I’ll do the
same!”</p>

<p>The vulgarity of the girl’s words offended
Nancy’s sense of respectable English, but she
knew better than to show her resentment.</p>

<p>“But, did you bring a message or something?”
she faltered. “Won’t they know you
have been here?”</p>

<p>“That’s my business, you just ’tend to
yours and don’t worry about mine,” snapped
the stranger.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference to me, of
course, that you’ve been here&mdash;Orilla,”
Nancy almost choked on the name, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
determined to show some good feeling which
she did not in the least feel&mdash;“and, if it suits
you better, I don’t see why I should tell
Rosa.”</p>

<p>“That’s sporty!” exclaimed the girl, a complete
change of her queer face, with its yellow
skin and other peculiar colorings of hair and
eyes, giving her a decidedly different expression.
“No use being enemies, when we’re
both outsiders,” she said next. “I must run
along. Don’t worry about party capes; they
never make folks happy!” and she was gone.</p>

<p>Her last words, although almost whispered,
left an unpleasant ring in Nancy’s ears.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about party capes,” she had
said, almost as if she had discovered Nancy’s
secret. And then: “They don’t make folks
happy!”</p>

<p>Orilla seemed glad of that. Evidently she
didn’t want party capes or other luxuries, of
which she herself had been deprived, to make
folks happy.</p>

<p>Nancy moved cautiously. She felt as if
she were still in danger&mdash;of what she could
not guess. But since she had so inadvertently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
made an ally of Orilla, instead of an enemy,
she knew she must be careful.</p>

<p>But was she now in league against Rosa?
That is, of course, from an outside viewpoint.
There could be no doubt of her action having
sprung from the most honorable motives.
She was doing a very distasteful thing, just to
protect Rosa, if possible, from Orilla’s secret
influence. Yet, this would be hard to understand,
and Nancy knew that it would be particularly
hard for Rosa to understand.</p>

<p>“Well,” she sighed to herself finally, as the
last faint echo of that almost silent step had
died away down the long hardwood hall,
“we’ll see what comes of it. But I didn’t
know what else to do.”</p>

<p>She stood for a moment at the door of
Rosa’s room as she left it. It was a beautiful
room; so much softness, such lovely silky
things all about, and the glow of the bird’s-eye
maple furniture stood out even in that
subdued light.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;!</p>

<p>How empty it was! How it lacked personality!
Even a certain untidiness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Nancy always remembered as a part of Ted’s
humble little room was, after all, so personal,
so Teddy-like!</p>

<p>The cape lay on the chair. It was a beautiful
cape, but now instead of being merely
beautiful to Nancy’s critical eye, it was the
symbol of something to be dreaded, to be
careful about, and to hold as secret!</p>

<p>Just as she turned to enter the room which
was now hers, Nancy pulled up sharply at the
sound of another step.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Nancy?” It was Margot
who put the question, and the sight of her was
indeed welcome to the perturbed girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Margot,” she replied, assuming as
much ease as she could command, “I was getting
a book from Rosa’s room. I’m going to
spend a whole evening reading.”</p>

<p>The woman, who was more than a maid yet
less than a relative, laid her white hand upon
Nancy’s arm.</p>

<p>“You will never regret having a fondness for
reading,” she said seriously. “There is nothing
better for a young girl than a good book.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve always loved to read,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Nancy, flushing under the compliment, “but
I’m afraid I like it too much. There are so
many other things to do, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course, there are other things to do,”
admitted Margot, sort of leading Nancy into
her room while she talked, “but I do believe
in lots of reading. I can’t get Rosalind to
read anything but the most absurd stuff,” her
voice was full of regret at this point. “Can
you imagine her reading boys’ books? And
detective stories?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” defended Nancy, “I know lots of
girls who do that. And boys’ books are good
reading, sometimes.” She feared each new
sentence from Margot would be a question
about the intruder, and hardly knew what she
herself was saying.</p>

<p>“But you see, my dear, it’s this way with
Rosa. Let’s sit down. I’ve been wanting a
few minutes’ talk with you.”</p>

<p>Nancy pulled out a comfortable chair into
which the portly Margot deposited herself.
A low boudoir chair, the sort with the lovely
square boxy arms, suited Nancy best and she
placed herself into that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
“Rosalind is still a darling baby,” went on
Margot. “Because her own dear mother had
to leave her when Rosalind was so young, I
suppose I am a little too easy with the child,
but you couldn’t understand how very hard it
is for me to be severe when I remember that
poor dear mother.”</p>

<p>Margot was surely genuine in her sympathy,
and as she talked Nancy felt that she could
understand. So that must be why Rosa had
always, or almost always, conquered Margot,
in spite of her usual talk to the contrary.</p>

<p>“She’s not half as rebellious as she pretends
to be,” Margot continued, “but I have some
worries.” She stopped and looked so keenly
at Nancy that the girl felt uncomfortable under
the scrutiny. Then she suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“Has she told you anything of this girl,
Orilla?”</p>

<p>“No, that is, nothing much,” truthfully
answered Nancy. “Mother has told me about
Orilla’s disappointment in having to leave
Uncle Frederic’s home,” she added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed the trusted woman, getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
up and preparing to leave, “I don’t mean to
ask you to spy on your cousin, but I should
be glad if you will do what you can to keep her
away from that girl.”</p>

<p>“I certainly intend to do that,” declared
Nancy, hardly recognizing her own voice.</p>

<p>“That’s right, dear, and you won’t be sorry.
This is sure to be a trying summer, with Mr.
and Mrs. Fred in Europe, and I’m so glad that
you are here. Rosa needs companionship.
No girl can grow up alone and be healthy,
mentally. To be sure, she has had her school
friends, but you see, my dear,” again the deep
sounding sigh, “it has been rather hard for her
to make friends. She’s so sensitive about her
size. Why, one girl at school last year just
followed Rosa around, she was so fond of her.
But the child just thought she was seeking
favors.”</p>

<p>Margot, with this confidence and her apparent
love for Rosa, had suddenly taken a
new hold on Nancy’s affections. After all, it
is a woman a girl needs, Nancy was determining,
and to her at that very moment&mdash;Margot
was the woman.</p>

<h2><a name="xv" id="xv"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span>MYSTERIOUS HAPPENINGS</span></h2>


<p>“I’ll be sound asleep,” Nancy decided, when
she was finally settled in bed after spending a
fitful hour trying to read. “It’s the only way.
I never could talk to Rosa to-night. To-morrow
things will seem different.”</p>

<p>Assuming her most restful attitude&mdash;lying
flat on her back with her face “boldly turned
up to Heaven,” as Ted called Nancy’s way of
wooing sleep, she tried to think calmly.</p>

<p>“But what did Orilla want to steal in for?”
persisted that question. “And even if she
didn’t want Margot to know that she came,
why should she want to deceive Rosa?</p>

<p>“But somehow I don’t believe she’s as
fierce as I thought she was at first,” continued
Nancy’s reasoning. “She’s sort of a bluffer,
for she looked frightened when I defied her.”</p>

<p>“Still, I believe it’s better not to have her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
for an enemy. She has sort of a catty look in
her green eyes, and cats are terribly sneaky
creatures.”</p>

<p>Thus her thoughts hovered, like a balancing
scale, for her encounter with the strange girl
had been too exciting to be very soon forgotten.</p>

<p>“And if Rosa finds out without fully understanding!”</p>

<p>That thought was the most difficult to argue
against, for the whole party cape episode had
now assumed the proportions of real trouble.</p>

<p>“And yet it has made Rosa think kindly of
Betty! Surely that is the most important
thing of all,” decided Nancy finally.</p>

<p>Trying to adjust all the other tangled ends
into this silken tassel of beauty, she lay there,
defying the ceiling to fall in her face, as the
constant thought of little brother Ted had
so often warned her it was sure to do, some
night, if she didn’t seek discreet refuge in the
kindly bed clothes.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be lovely for everyone, especially
for dear Uncle Frederic, if Rosa would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
become reconciled to the stepmother. Uncle
Frederic loved Betty and Betty had loved
Rosa’s own mother; why, therefore, could not
Rosa try to be grateful instead of rebellious?</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Nancy that Rosa was
staying out rather late. Even being over to
Durand’s did not seem to warrant this late
home-coming.</p>

<p>Night has a queer influence upon thought,
and even a girl like Nancy, always brave and
courageous when on her feet, could feel rather
timid about things lying there in the dark, and
staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>What if Orilla had lain in wait for Rosa and
enticed her to go away or something? What
if Orilla had demanded money from Rosa?
Would Orilla steal? That house had been the
girl’s home and it was not strange that she
should sometimes want to visit it, came a
more reasonable suggestion. And surely she
would not steal, was the answer to that question.</p>

<p>But Nancy could not feign slumber, for her
mind was too active to forget that the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
patch above her was the ceiling, and not a
bird’s downy wing, bringing sleep, as the
poets warrant.</p>

<p>Where was her mother now? So far across
the sea that even the time there was not the
same as that which ticked away patiently on
Nancy’s dresser. But her mother would
surely enjoy the visit to those famous shrines
of knowledge, for Nancy’s mother loved to
learn.</p>

<p>That darling mother! So pretty, so sweet,
so kind and always so helpful! A deep, audible
sigh escaped the girl on the bed as she
indulged in this deliberation. Her mother
had always been so like a girl chum, so companionable
and such a refuge in trouble.</p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t lean on her,” came the
accusing thought. “If I cannot rely upon
myself, then mother’s teaching would not
have been well learned.”</p>

<p>Following that came the thoughts of industrious
little Miss Manners&mdash;Manny to Nancy
and Ted. Then all the girl friends, who this
summer seemed so far away, paraded before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Nancy’s fancy, as they had so often done in
reality.</p>

<p>A slammed door rudely broke up the soliloquy.</p>

<p>“Rosa!” exclaimed Nancy gladly, although
Rosa was not yet in sight. “I’m so glad she’s
home safe!”</p>

<p>The relief was so great that Nancy promptly
turned over and feigned sleep. She really
couldn’t talk to Rosa to-night, and she was
sure her cousin would be just bubbling over
with the evening’s news.</p>

<p>A step in the hall, a halting at the door and
then the whispered call:</p>

<p>“Nancy!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nancy promptly, recognizing
something unusual in Rosa’s voice.</p>

<p>“Awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then turn on the light.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you act so&mdash;so&mdash;” Nancy switched
on the <a name="bedside" id="bedside"></a><ins title="Original has 'bedisde'">bedside</ins> light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
“I’m just sort&mdash;of&mdash;out of breath.”</p>

<p>“Been running?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Silly, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But what made you run, Rosa? You
haven’t a puff in you.”</p>

<p>“I know. But my puffs give out easily.”
Rosa had sunk into the nearest chair and was
breathing uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“But why? Did something frighten you?”
pressed Nancy.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;I was at the very door, Dell and
Gar came to the very threshold with me, and
then&mdash;oh, dear, what makes me puff so?”
Rosa was still very much “out of breath.”</p>

<p>“What was at the door?” questioned Nancy.
She felt a little guilty in her relentlessness.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I was just opening it when I
thought&mdash;I thought I heard a kitten. And I
perfectly hate to leave a little baby kitten
crying&mdash;all&mdash;night. Don’t you?” Rosa managed
to ask.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course I do,” replied Nancy irritably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
“But why should a crying kitten scare
you?”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;didn’t.”</p>

<p>“What was it, then? For mercy sakes!
You’ve got me all worked up,” declared Nancy,
who by now was out of bed and standing
in front of Rosa’s chair.</p>

<p>“That’s just how I am; all worked up, so
please don’t make me any worse. In the
language of the poets, I’m ‘all&mdash;in!’”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you don’t want to tell me,”
and Nancy turned back toward her bed, sullenly.</p>

<p>“But I do want to tell you; I’m just dying
to, if you’ll only give me a chance. Nancy,
you know you are horribly impatient. We
can’t all be firecrackers like you.” Rosa was
recovering her breath, her spirits and her use
of language.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. But when I thought I heard the
kitten I crawled very carefully around to the
side porch. You know how kittens can scat.
And the porch was dark as pitch, so,” Rosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
was drawing out the story with provoking
detail, “so, I called kitty, kitty, kitty! And
I waited and listened. No kitty meowed an
answer, and I was just turning back to the
door when&mdash;something crashed down on the
porch! Didn’t you hear it?”</p>

<p>“No; what was it?”</p>

<p>“Betty’s prettiest fernery, the white enameled
one decorated with butterflies and flowers.
Dad bought it for her when she came up here&mdash;a&mdash;bride!”
There was tragedy in Rosa’s
tones.</p>

<p>“But you must have knocked it over,”
argued Nancy, none too sure of her assertion.</p>

<p>“I didn’t! I couldn’t have! I was nowhere
near it!”</p>

<p>“Then who&mdash;could&mdash;have?” faltered Nancy.</p>

<p>“Someone who&mdash;wanted to spite Betty,”
Rosa almost whispered this, and still seemed
rather shaken from her fright.</p>

<p>“I should suppose everyone in this house
would understand his or her duty to Betty,”
insisted Nancy. “I guess that tall little stand
went over in the wind, Rosa. You know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
gales can shoot up from the lake. Have a
nice time at Durand’s?”</p>

<p>“Lov-ell-ly, but they mourned over <em>you</em> not
coming. You have stolen Gar’s heart from
me, I’m afraid,” teased Rosa. “He just kept
saying nice things about you all the time.
And we’re going to the hotel to-morrow night.
You can’t imagine how excited I am&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you awfully late? Does Margot
know you are out so late?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I phoned her hours ago and
fixed it all up&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosa, I don’t want to be preachy,” interrupted
Nancy, recalling poor Margot’s serious
appeal for her help, “but I can’t see what fun
you get out of fooling Margot. She thinks
such heaps about you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know. She’s a duck. But one has to
have some fun, so I take&mdash;mine&mdash;this way,”
and Rosa swung herself about saucily. “Not
that I blame you, little Coz, for trying to
reform me. It’s right good of you,” and she
flicked a kiss on Nancy’s cheek as she prepared
to take herself off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Nancy was eager to do something definite,
and she knew that Rosa’s present mood was
not too often displayed. Therefore she risked
a straight appeal to the other’s honor.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we ought to pledge ourselves
to be truthful at least, while your father
is away?”</p>

<p>“Truthful?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Not to deceive each other or Margot
or anyone who has a right to our&mdash;our confidence,”
finished Nancy, rather laboriously.</p>

<p>Rosa sighed. “That would be awfully hard
to carry out,” she said. “For me, at least.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Nancy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just can’t tell you at this hour.
Let’s go to bed and dream of&mdash;to-morrow
night’s dance.”</p>

<p>“All right, Rosa,” assented Nancy, “but
you have no idea how scary it is here when
you are out too late. I can well imagine how
Margot feels. It’s really very strange to me,
for you are awfully young to be so&mdash;so&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sporty!” lisped Rosa rather comically.</p>

<p>“No, not that,” Nancy scoffed. “We’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
nothing but school girls, and I’m no good at
pretending I’m grown up. But anyhow,
Rosa, I hope <em>you</em> won’t worry me to death!”</p>

<p>In answer to that the cousins reverted to
the true girlship they were discussing, for
Rosa fell upon Nancy’s bed, and the way they
talked, and the things they talked of, proved
them girls, no more nor less.</p>

<span>DOOMED TO DISASTER</span></h2>


<p>How that next day went by Nancy never
knew. It seemed made up of moments, minutes,
hours, and then a day of such confusion!</p>

<p>First thing in the morning there was general
excitement over the breaking of the beautiful
fernery. It had been one of Lady Betty’s pet
pieces, and one of her bridal gifts. Also,
Margot herself had tended and coaxed the
beautiful ferns and flowers in the long, narrow
basket to their fullest perfection, so that Margot
felt a sense of personal loss in its destruction.</p>

<p>And it had really been destroyed; not only
knocked over and broken, but the fine enameled
pottery was completely demolished, and
the beautiful growing stuff crushed to a pulp!</p>

<p>No prowling dog could have been so thorough
in its work, everyone said, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Nancy knew who had been prowling about,
and only Nancy knew who, that very evening,
had said things against the luxuries of the
rich. And the fernery was a luxury.</p>

<p>Already the secret, which had been so curiously
thrust upon her, was bringing its bitter
penalty to Nancy. She had acted from the
highest and most honorable motives, and yet,
that little intrigue with Orilla, secretly knowing
that she had been not only on the premises
but actually in the house, through the rooms&mdash;all
this brought to Nancy a sense of guilt.</p>

<p>Then, the broken fernery! Was that a part
of Orilla’s depredation? Would she really
destroy things in her dislike for the people of
Fernlode? It was before lunch that Rosa,
first intent upon a swim, suddenly changed
her mind and without explanation ran off
some place; where, Nancy didn’t know.</p>

<p>“Back in a jiffy!” Rosa had called as she
went as fast as her weight allowed, toward
Gar’s waiting car.</p>

<p>And she hadn’t even invited Nancy to go
along!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
From that time until the lunch bell rang,
Nancy could not entirely fight down her feelings.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to be treated this way,” she
decided, “I can go to Manny at any time.
Manny made me promise I would, if I were
not happy here.”</p>

<p>But, when Rosa came back just in time for
lunch, and made her take a pretty new fan she
had bought for the evening’s dance, reasonably,
Nancy had to excuse her.</p>

<p>The postponed swim was taken in the afternoon,
Rosa going out to the big rock and
perching herself like a nice, fat bird upon it,
while Nancy spent most of her time practising
diving from the long dock.</p>

<p>All along the banks of the summer colony
young folks were enjoying the water sports,
and Nancy quite forgot her new anxieties as
she too indulged in the pleasant aquatic
exercise.</p>

<p>Just once Rosa became confidential. She
asked Nancy if she knew anything about reducing
systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
“Why?” laughed Nancy. “You are not
going to try one, I hope.”</p>

<p>“One!” exclaimed Rosa. “I’ve tried dozens
of them. Want to see me do the twelve-pound
roll?” and without waiting for any
encouragement Rosa raced out of the water,
ran up the little sandy road that led from a
hill down to the water’s edge, and then proceeded
to roll!</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Rosa!” yelled Nancy. “You
might strike a rock!”</p>

<p>But Rosa was rolling on.</p>

<p>Down, down she came, gathering speed
with every turn and adding to her peril with it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosa! Grab something!” yelled
Nancy. “You’ll hit your head on those
rocks!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I won’t,” Rosa managed to
eject, each little word puffing out like a small
explosion.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop you,” offered Nancy, jumping out
in the path of the whirlwind.</p>

<p>“No, don’t! I must&mdash;go&mdash;all&mdash;the way!”</p>

<p>“But how silly! You’re a cloud of dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and&mdash;and&mdash;just see those rocks!” entreated
Nancy.</p>

<p>Still Rosa kept on tumbling along, first
down the very steep sand slope, and then over
a sharp turn not intended to be used as a road.
It was the end of the hill slope that twined in
to the boat house, and the lakeside drive did
not connect with this, as the lake and its drive
were at right angles.</p>

<p>It was over that sharp edge of rocks that
Rosa tumbled, then, with one more blind turn,
her heavy little body splashed into the lake at
least ten feet below!</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosa!”</p>

<p>Nancy’s yell was one of terror, but she did
not wait to hear its effect, for the next moment
she too was over the dock and into the water,
grappling with the stunned girl, who seemed
prone to go under the water every time Nancy
attempted to assist her.</p>

<p>“Put your hand on my shoulder,” Nancy
ordered, “but don’t grab me. Rosa! Rosa!
Can’t you hear?”</p>

<p>Then, realizing that her cousin must indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
be stunned, Nancy shouted lustily for help.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! At the landing!” she
screamed, meanwhile getting hold of Rosa’s
little skirt and trying desperately to raise the
girl to the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The moments were agonizing, but Nancy
tried to keep up her courage, calling as she
struggled. But there was very little hope for
immediate response, since each estate encompassed
a large strip of territory and the bathers
were now scattered, in canoes, most of them
following the sun to dry out, down near the big
float.</p>

<p>Finally, Nancy heard the welcome sound of
disturbed water, and then saw approaching
the Fernlode dock, a small launch.</p>

<p>“This way! This way!” she yelled frantically,
her own strength ebbing from her
continued paddling to keep afloat, and grabbing
for a better hold on Rosa, for the water
off the big bank at the side of the dock was
suddenly deep, and decidedly treacherous,
real depth being necessary for boat landings.</p>

<p>The launch was now alongside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“Oh, quickly, please!” begged Nancy. “I
think she’s stunned.”</p>

<p>Then she saw that the boat was being run
by Orilla! And she was, as usual, alone.</p>

<p>“Don’t get so excited,” snapped the girl.
“I don’t see what you’re so scared of. She
could wade out of there.”</p>

<p>“But she hasn’t spoken. Oh, Orilla, please
get hold of her. I tell you she’s&mdash;stunned!”</p>

<p>In spite of her seeming indifference, Orilla
was leaning over the side of the launch, and
with her help Nancy had managed to get Rosa
to the surface. She opened her eyes, sputtered
water from her mouth, gasped, gagged
and gurgled as if she were almost choked with
water. Holding to the low side of the launch,
Nancy ordered and bossed like a real life saver,
but Rosa, although now able to help herself,
made little headway at doing so.</p>

<p>Orilla scolded and grumbled. She hadn’t
time for such foolishness, and a girl who
couldn’t get up on her own dock ought to
drown&mdash;according to her.</p>

<p>“She’s got to get into your boat,” insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Nancy, “she can’t climb to the dock.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, get in,” growled Orilla,
“and be quick about it. I’ve got to hurry!”</p>

<p>“You always have,” retorted Nancy, none
too pleasantly. “It seems to me, you might
try to be&mdash;human, once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Good enough for <em>you</em> to talk,” flung back
the other girl. “But you don’t know what
you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rosa managed to gurgle, “and it’s
all your fault, Orilla Rigney, I’ve never had
any&mdash;any peace since&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut it!” yelled the red-haired girl, so
sharply that even Nancy, who was on the end
of the dock, turned suddenly to see the girl’s
face masked in rage.</p>

<p>Rosa was now in the launch, Nancy sat, exhausted,
on the end of the dock, but Orilla, at
the engine, looked so peculiarly excited that
instinctively Nancy shouted:</p>

<p>“Wait! Don’t&mdash;start!”</p>

<p>But the engine had picked up and that
launch was steaming off, Rosa still apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
too stunned to protest, and Nancy was powerless!</p>

<p>“Where are <em>you</em> going?” Nancy shouted,
quickly as she could recover from her surprise.</p>

<p>But no answer came back; nothing but the
chug-chug of the engine, and the boat’s daring
cut through the water.</p>

<p>“Rosa!” yelled the distracted Nancy.
“Come back&mdash;”</p>

<p>Rosa turned and waved a fluttering hand,
not gayly but sort of resignedly. And Nancy
knew that all she, herself, could do was to&mdash;wait!</p>

<p>Certainly Orilla was heading her boat
across the narrow end of the lake, at which
point the water was sucked up by any number
of little land patches, hills and foothills of the
mountains. To land in any one of these
would mean almost complete seclusion&mdash;for
the thick evergreens made tiny forests of the
islands. It was among these little islands
that Nancy watched, impotently, for the last
speck of color that identified the launch.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do!” she moaned aloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
“Rosa is not fit to go off with that girl. And
who can go after her?”</p>

<p>The memory of Mrs. Pixley’s plight out on
No Man’s Land, the evening that Rosa and
Nancy went to her rescue, now came back to
Nancy, with Rosa placed in the same predicament.</p>

<p>“If she ever leaves her out there alone,” she
worried, this time without speaking aloud,
“we may not be able to find the spot.”</p>

<p>“Hello! What’s the mermaid pondering&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gar!” gasped Nancy, turning to find
their friend almost beside her upon the dock.
“That girl, Orilla, has gone off with Rosa.
And Rosa had been stunned from a fall down
the hill into the water.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me, Nancy, you’re pretty well
stunned yourself,” spoke up the boy. “You
look all in.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me, please! But think,
quickly! What can we do to get&mdash;Rosa!”</p>

<p>“What makes you so dreadfully worried?”</p>

<p>Then poor Nancy tried to explain what had
happened. As she talked she did feel her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
loss of strength, as Gar had said, she was
almost exhausted herself.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” comforted the boy. “I’ll
get Paul and we’ll race out in our launch. I
guess Orilla Rigney can’t beat the Whitecap
and I guess she doesn’t know any more about
mushroom islands than I do. You want to
come along, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I couldn’t stand the anxiety of
waiting,” Nancy answered. “I’ll get into dry
things&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I’ll pull in here for you in a couple of
jiffs,” Gar assured her, offering her his hand
as she left the dock by the shortest cut&mdash;the
hill that had proved too much for Rosa’s rolling
exercise.</p>

<p>“Do you think I had better tell Margot?”
Nancy asked, when they had reached the point
where their paths divided.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, better not. You see, when we get
Rosa and fetch her back she’ll just think we
have all been off for a sail.”</p>

<p>And Nancy knew as he spoke, that here was
another boy with a disposition very much like
Ted’s.</p>

<h2><a name="xvii" id="xvii"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span>SCOUTING FOR THE TRUANTS</span></h2>


<p>If Rosa had been rebellious and uncertain
in her conduct, her friends Gar and Dell were
just the opposite, it seemed to Nancy. Waiting
now a few minutes for Gar to return with
his motor boat, Nancy tried to keep down her
anxieties by building her courage upon the
assistance of Gar, and as he presently hailed
her from the landing, she saw that his sister
Dell was with him.</p>

<p>“Two heads are better than one,” he said
simply, as Nancy stepped into the launch.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Dell remarked. “Gar and
I know those islands, although we haven’t had
a chance to do any exploring lately.”</p>

<p>“But why should Orilla do that?” questioned
Nancy. “She knew perfectly well that
Rosa had been exhausted in the water and was
unfit for anything but rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
“You can never ask why, where that creature
is concerned,” answered Dell. “She’s the
unaccountable. Doesn’t do any real harm
but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How awful close she does come to it,” put
in Gar, who was tending the smoothly running
little engine, as Nancy sat near by and
watched.</p>

<p>“This lake turns up real waves, doesn’t it?”
she remarked when a sheet of spray swept
their deck.</p>

<p>“You bet,” answered Gar, blinking to clear
his eyes of the mist.</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t going to storm,” Nancy
added, apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Not right away, at any rate,” answered
Dell. “And the islands aren’t far away.
Better swing left, Gar. Here comes the
steamer from the Weirs.”</p>

<p>The swell from the big steamer struck the
Whitecap presently, giving its occupants such
a merry ride, that only their present upset
state of mind prevented them from keenly
enjoying it. Even the excursionists, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
waved frantically at them, received scant attention
in return, for there was no denying
their anxiety. They must find Rosa, and they
must take her away from Orilla Rigney, no
matter what else happened.</p>

<p>Purposely Dell Durand avoided criticizing
Rosa to Nancy, but this consideration could
not entirely prevent Nancy from expressing
something of her own confused opinion.</p>

<p>“You never saw anything like it,” she recalled.
“No sooner had Rosa gotten into the
boat than Orilla seemed to pounce upon that
engine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Like a beast upon its prey,” finished Gar,
as a boy would when such a chance for such an
expression was so obviously offered.</p>

<p>“She should not be allowed to come over to
our side of the lake at all,” went on Dell. “She
has no business there and our docks are private
property.”</p>

<p>“But the lake isn’t,” her brother reminded
her.</p>

<p>“Try Crow’s Nest first,” suggested Dell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
“That’s a little place and we can scout over it
in no time.”</p>

<p>“Think I better&mdash;blow?” Gar asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Nancy. “Can’t tell what Orilla
might do if she had time to do it.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!”</p>

<p>With a soft swish through the water the boat
glided into shore, with the engine turned off.</p>

<p>Silently the three landed. Gar found a
stout young tree to throw his boat rope
around and in accord, without the need of
questions, each of them immediately faced the
little wilderness in a different direction.</p>

<p>“We’ll come together by the big pine&mdash;see,
right on top of the hill,” Dell suggested, pointing
out the big sentinel pine that stood guard
over Crow’s Nest.</p>

<p>“Better take a good, strong club,” Gar
advised Nancy. “Wait, I see one,” and he
made his way through brambles and briars to
procure the end of a young birch that had evidently
been broken in a storm.</p>

<p>Nancy thanked him, and with the staff
began to beat her path through the bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
They did not really expect to find the girls
actually hidden in the underbrush, but Orilla’s
habits were said to be so unusual that the
scouts were prepared to find her busy at almost
any camping detail on the island, if indeed it
was this island upon which she had landed.</p>

<p>“Do you know that she carries a hatchet in
her car?” Nancy asked, when Dell had come
near enough for conversation, “I can’t see
what she would want with such tools as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, frankly, Nancy,” Dell replied, “I
wouldn’t be surprised to hear that she carried
a shotgun, for the reputation given her around
here is as vague as it is mysterious. Everybody
seems to have a different story about
Orilla Rigney.”</p>

<p>“Yet she’s&mdash;industrious, and honest, I suppose,”
pressed Nancy.</p>

<p>“All of that&mdash;too industrious. She not
only works herself but wants to make the
whole world work with her. Perhaps she’s a
case of misdirected energy. You know, Nancy,
they say nowadays that that’s as bad as sheer
laziness,” explained the older girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Sounds from treetops or from thickets attracted
their notice then, and conversation
was suddenly discontinued. But no sign of
human life rewarded the most careful scrutiny
of the searchers.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they could be around here
without making some noise,” Dell remarked.</p>

<p>“Take&mdash;no&mdash;chances!” hissed Gar, striking
a comical poise with his mountain stick held
high above his head, and his free arm struck
out at right angles. His attempt at humor
was rewarded with a wan smile from Nancy,
but Dell only waved her club threateningly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a lot of ground to cover, you
know, Gar,” said Dell seriously, “and we
mustn’t forget there is no guarantee of continued
fair weather.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to yell,” the boy suddenly announced.
“Better take a chance on Rosa
hearing us than leave it all to the big gray
fox.”</p>

<p>A series of mountain calls followed. They
were varied, queer, weird, owlish and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
funny, for Gar proved to be an expert in the
art.</p>

<p>No answer came. Instead, the silence of
the woods after its interruption seemed even
deeper than before.</p>

<p>Nancy sighed aloud, Dell did not try very
hard to hide her own impatience and Gar
protested openly.</p>

<p>“If we find her this time I think we ought to
lock her up,” he said, not entirely in jest.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;am ashamed of her,” admitted Nancy.
“But she really didn’t do this. She actually
blamed Orilla for her tumble in the lake,” she
recalled.</p>

<p>“That’s probably why,” declared Gar, “the
orang-utan is now getting even.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll just try the other side of the
oaks,” proposed Dell, “then, we had better
try some place else.”</p>

<p>The little island covered only a small strip
of land, which was made an island by a blade
of the lake water that cut it away from another
strip of land. To explore the entire
territory took but a short time, and now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
scouting party were scurrying down the other
side of the summit, looking for the truants
along the water front at that point.</p>

<p>“Someone has been here lately,” Gar declared,
as he kicked over a small stone furnace.
“This always was a favorite spot for campers,
you know, Dell.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She surveyed the charred stones.
“But our campers haven’t been here. That
stuff is old.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we had better shout
again?” suggested Nancy. “I’m afraid Margot
will be scared to death, although I did call
something to her about going to the Point.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it beat the chickens!” murmured
Gar. “Just imagine us hunting for those girls
like a couple of lost&mdash;kids. Makes me think
of our picnics long ago when <em>I</em> was the star for
getting lost.”</p>

<p>“You were clever that way, boy,” replied his
sister, “but please don’t try it now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” begged Nancy, frightened instantly.
“Whatever would we do if you&mdash;got
lost?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
“Don’t worry, I won’t. No fun in it without
ice cream cones. But there’s nary a one
on this safety isle. Let’s get in the launch and
skirt the edges of the whole place. We can’t
possibly beat down bushes on all these piles of
rocks.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we can’t,” Dell agreed. “But suppose
they didn’t come in here at all? And
where could she have left the launch?”</p>

<p>“She could hide that almost any place along
here, for the edge has a regular curtain of
young trees,” the brother answered. “Nancy,
don’t look so dejected. When we find your
cousin, maybe we shall find she has gone down
to the ideal weight. I believe that’s the main
issue with poor old Rosalind.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t find her in any more trouble,”
Nancy replied. “But I’m never sure about
her when she dashes off with Orilla. This is
about the third or fourth escapade she has
starred in since I came to Craggy Bluff.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t count all she has starred in since
I came up,” Gar said dryly, as he untied the
boat. The girls quickly stepped in and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
promptly started up the willing engine.</p>

<p>Each new move in their expedition only
brought greater anxiety to Nancy, for in spite
of her companions’ insistent attempts at gaiety,
she, as well as they, felt that the finding
of Rosa was by no means assured.</p>

<p>And it was so lonely, away out there, with
shadows closing in from the sky, from the
mountains and from the heavy growth of all
sorts of trees, high and low, leafy and stark,
in their pretty covering of silken foliage, or in
their defiant armor of pine needles!</p>

<p>But nothing seemed beautiful; everything
seemed sinister, and even the lapping of the
waves against the rocks now struck terror into
Nancy’s heart.</p>

<p>Vacation? She had forgotten the word.
Pleasure seemed very far away, if not entirely
beyond her reach. All she thought of, all she
wanted, was to find the unfortunate Rosalind.</p>

<p>“I’ll swing in here and let’s try that comic
opera again,” said Gar, determined to keep up
their courage.</p>

<p>“The opera” was made up of the shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and calls, such as they had been practising
ever since they decided to break the woodland
silence, and following Gar’s advice they again
took up the refrain.</p>

<p>“There’s a few birds answering, at any
rate,” Dell remarked, “but for my part, I
think even the angels must have heard that
yell of yours, Gar. If those girls are in these
woodlands they either do not want to reply
or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s the boat!” exclaimed Nancy, jumping
up so suddenly she all but fell over in the
launch. “I see it in that little clump of willows!
Steer in there, Gar. They can’t be
far away from their boat.”</p>

<p>And only too willingly did Garfield Durand
comply with that eager request.</p>

<span>THE WOODCHOPPERS</span></h2>


<p>Under the willows, almost hidden in the
vine-like foliage, they found the small motor
boat that Orilla was in the habit of using. It
was not her own, but belonged to a summer
place that had not been opened for a few years
past, and the owners were allowing Orilla to
use the boat in return for some small care she
gave to special plants upon the grounds and
surroundings.</p>

<p>“That’s the boat, all right,” Gar announced,
as he shoved alongside. “And just look at
the&mdash;timber!”</p>

<p>The timber consisted of small trees, newly
cut into pole lengths and placed into the
launch, evidently ready to be carried off.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” remarked Dell. “What
can she want those for?”</p>

<p>“Not for wood,” Nancy replied. “That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
would stay green all winter. But let’s hurry
and hunt. Shall we call now?”</p>

<p>“Here’s their path,” replied Gar, instead of
answering. “See how fresh the broken weeds
are. Let’s follow this a&mdash;ways.”</p>

<p>Nancy’s heart was fairly jumping with excitement.
She did not want to guess at how
they might find Rosa; whether she would be
lying sick in that dark, damp woods, or&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hello there!” came a sharp call. “Meet
Miss Robinson Crusoe&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rosa!” exclaimed Nancy. “Oh, Rosa!”
She couldn’t seem to say anything else just
then, the sight of Rosa was such a relief.</p>

<p>“Rosalind Fernell!” was Dell’s emphatic
greeting.</p>

<p>“Runaway Rosie,” chuckled Gar, his stout
stick beating viciously at the greenery that
choked the little pathway.</p>

<p>By this time Rosa was in full view, and the
searchers beheld her lugging great bundles of
young saplings, her arms scratched and torn
from her efforts to carry more of the poles
than she could properly manage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
“Why the woodyard?” asked Gar, laconically.</p>

<p>“They’re for Orilla&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Any objections?” demanded the girl just
spoken of. She also was now visible, having
come through a mass of clotted hazel nut trees,
and she too looked like a picture from some
foreign land, where women do all the chores.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have objections, Orilla Rigney,”
spoke up Dell, sharply, “and you ought to
know well enough what they are.”</p>

<p>“Let’s help them load their boat,” interposed
Nancy, fearful that the unpleasant discussion
would develop into something more
serious. “Here, Rosa, I’ll take some of
those&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;please,” murmured Rosa, her voice
now betraying what Nancy feared&mdash;exhaustion.
“I’m almost dead,” she whispered, as
the defiant Orilla made her way down to the
boat. “I was never so frightened in&mdash;my
life!”</p>

<p>“Neither was I,” returned Nancy. “I’m
shaking yet. What ever got into her&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
“Hush! She’s excited and ugly&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What ever&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me lug those logs if you must have
them,” called out Gar, in his roughly frank,
boyish way. “Goin’ to start a new cure,
Orilla? Is this tree bark good for snake bites
or something?”</p>

<p>“What I’m going to start is my own business,”
snapped back Orilla, throwing her vivid
head up high and bracing her thin body to
carry the heavy load of wood. She was wearing
a khaki suit, like a uniform, but even this,
strong as the material must have been, showed
more than one jagged tear from violent contact
with the young trees, which must have
struggled bravely against her cruel little ax.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” drawled Gar,
good-naturedly. “Here, Nancy and Rosa,
let’s help you. Maybe you’re not quite so
fussy.”</p>

<p>Willingly enough Nancy and Rosa relinquished
the rough sticks, their hands smarting
and red from trying to tote them down to the
water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
No one said much, everyone seemed to realize
that that was the only way to avoid
trouble, for Orilla seemed ready to snap at
every word, and the thing to do, obviously,
was to get in their boats and sail away from
Mushroom Islands, promptly.</p>

<p>“But it’s all too silly,” grumbled Dell aside
to her own friends. “Why should we humor
that girl?”</p>

<p>“We are almost ready to go now,” Rosa
coaxed. “And it is so killing hard to chop
down those trees. Just look at my poor
hands!”</p>

<p>The poor hands represented a pitiable sight
indeed, for being pudgy and fat, they were
easily bruised and torn, so that their surface
now looked like nothing other than bruises
and scratches.</p>

<p>Unwillingly they went back once more to
the little woodland, where the devastation had
been perpetrated, and there they gathered up
what remained of the felled trees.</p>

<p>“You must have worked hard, Rosa,” Gar
commented. “Why don’t you go in the business?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Put a sign out, ‘Woodlands Cleared
While You Wait.’ I tell you, I tried once on
our back woods and didn’t do anything like as
well as this&mdash;”</p>

<p>To which Rosa did not risk a reply, for the
quarrelsome Orilla was at her elbow directing
the gleaning in no uncertain tones.</p>

<p>But it was not so easy to suppress Gar. He
wasn’t afraid of Orilla Rigney, and he was
willing to let folks know it.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s enough,” he decided sharply.
“We’re not going to take another stick. If
you want to chop down trees, Orilla, why don’t
you hire help? Or why don’t you choose a
woods nearer civilization?”</p>

<p>“What are you grumbling about?” retorted
Orilla, letting drop more than one of the sticks
she had just picked up. “I didn’t ask your
help, and I don’t want it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But there’s a storm coming, Orilla,” said
Nancy very kindly, as kindly as she might
have spoken to some troublesome child, “and
we had better all hurry back. There now, it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
all cleared up. Here, give me that long one.
I haven’t an armful this time.”</p>

<p>So for the moment peace was restored, and
the queer proceedings continued, until at last
even Orilla seemed satisfied that the task had
been properly finished.</p>

<p>Only to Nancy did she deign a pleasant
look, and that look, Nancy thought, was
rather secretive. For as the girl did half
smile, she also winked one of her green, gimlet
eyes, as if trying to convey to Nancy a message
not meant for the others. This recalled
the party cape episode, when Nancy compromised
by agreeing, at least partly, not to
mention Orilla’s secret visit.</p>

<p>“But we found you, Rosa, at any rate,”
Nancy repeated, as again they paired off.
“I’ll never be able to tell you how I felt,” she
continued, giving the truant cousin a reassuring
pinch.</p>

<p>Rosa rolled her eyes meaningly. “If you
hadn’t&mdash;” She left that contingency to Nancy’s
over-worked imagination, and again
turned to help Orilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
“Don’t bother; just go along,” ordered
Orilla rudely.</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going too?” Rosa questioned
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Seems to me folks are awfully worried
about what <em>I’m</em> going to do,” snapped Orilla.
“But if you’ll all go along and take your pet
with you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orilla Rigney!” called out Dell authoritatively.
“What is the matter with you?
Are you determined to make enemies of even
those who are trying to help you?”</p>

<p>Nancy turned quickly to interpose, and as
she caught a queer expression on Orilla’s face
she hurried to answer Dell before the other
could do so.</p>

<p>“Now, Dell, please don’t be cross,” begged
Nancy with a sly glance intended for Dell
alone. “We had all best be going if we hope
to escape that storm. Just see those clouds!”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called out Gar. “Orilla,
can’t I push your boat out for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I’m not ready yet.”</p>

<p>“But the storm,” pleaded Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
“I’m not afraid of storms. I love them.”</p>

<p>“Out here, all alone?”</p>

<p>“I have birds and all the wild life of the
woods. They are the friends I can depend
upon,” replied Orilla. And as she said this
her voice was soft, pleasant, actually musical.
It was plain where her affections lay.</p>

<p>“All right. Sorry. Hop in, girls. I’m
heading straight for the other shore,” Gar
made known, starting up the engine as he
talked.</p>

<p>Reluctantly they turned away from the
solitary figure on the shore. She looked like
a creature of the woods, indeed, the brown
outline of her form merging so completely into
the shadows, that it was scarcely distinguishable
as the watchers swung around the end of
the island.</p>

<p>“Why won’t she come?” queried Nancy
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Because she won’t let us see where she
goes,” replied Rosa.</p>

<p>“And don’t you know?” pressed Nancy
further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
“No. She had promised to take me this
afternoon&mdash;but&mdash;oh, well&mdash;” sighed Rosa.
“I’m glad you came and I don’t care much
about her promises now. I guess I’ve been
pretty&mdash;foolish.”</p>

<p>“Only guess so?” put in Dell, in a way naturally
expected from her, as the oldest member
of the party. “We’ve been <em>sure</em> of that all
summer. Just imagine, cutting down trees
and doing that silly stuff!”</p>

<p>“Now, Dell,” objected Rosa, a little huffed,
“you must know I did have <em>some</em> reason. I’m
not altogether a simpleton, I hope.”</p>

<p>“So do we&mdash;hope,” flung back Gar over his
shoulder. “But there’s a boat I’ve got to tow
in. See them waving? Hold tight; I’ve got
to turn sharp and these waves are pretty
frisky.”</p>

<p>All hands now turned their attention to the
fisherman’s boat, a little rowboat, quite helpless
against the fury into which the lake was
working its surface. It took but a very short
time to reach the craft, then a man flung Gar
a line which the boy pulled up until he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
tie it securely into the stern lock of the Whitecap.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Pixley!” shouted Rosa. “See
her trying to hold on to the fish. She’s sitting
in the bottom of the boat.”</p>

<p>And those who looked saw the little woman
just as Rosa said, trying desperately to keep
her cargo from being washed overboard.</p>

<p>As she recognized the party in the Whitecap,
however, she managed to shout her delight,
for it appears she and her pilot had been
battling the waves for some time before the
launch came along.</p>

<p>“Ought to call you girls life-savers,” she
called out. “This is the second time you have
saved mine.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the third,” joked Nancy to Rosa,
“for if I hadn’t saved her from the mob in the
train when that grape juice bottle exploded&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Nancy just then saw a speck of light,
like a spark, over in one of the group of islands
from which they had lately embarked.</p>

<p>And it couldn’t have been lightning, for the
storm, though imminent, had not yet broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and there was no rumble of thunder even in
the distance.</p>

<p>She looked again, made sure of the spot, but
said nothing to her companions. The appeal
Orilla had silently given her, with that glance
from her deep-set eyes, seemed to Nancy too
pathetic to be made light of. And perhaps
the spark of light in the woodland, away out
there where nothing but low, scrubby pine
trees grew, had something to do with Orilla’s
secret. At any rate this was no time to discuss
it. Confusion forbade.</p>

<p>“We’ll be in before it hits us,” called Gar
gayly, surveying the racing storm clouds.</p>

<p>“And a good thing for us,” added his sister,
“for even this launch is not altogether safe in a
real lake hurricane.”</p>

<h2><a name="xix" id="xix"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span>QUEER CONFIDENCE</span></h2>


<p>When the excitement died down, and Nancy
found an opportunity to “look Rosa over,” as
she expressed her scrutiny of the cousin’s
physical condition, she found so many cuts,
scratches, bruises and other marks of violence,
that she really wanted to call Margot in to
attend to their cleansing and bandaging.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Nance, they’re all right,” insisted
Rosa rather petulantly. “I don’t poison
easily and those are all scratches from the
trees and bushes.”</p>

<p>“But just see that long cut on the side of
your leg&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A wire, I guess it was a barbed wire&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s always dangerous,” interrupted
Nancy. “The rust is one of the worst things.
Rosa, how could you be so silly?” Nancy’s
patience was by no means abundant. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
hated to see Rosa’s skin torn that way; besides,
she realized the danger of it.</p>

<p>“Nancy Brandon!” called out the cousin in
a determined voice, “you have no idea what I
went through. Orilla acted like a lunatic and
I was honestly afraid of her. She seems quite
fond of you&mdash;” there was sarcasm in this&mdash;“that
is, she spoke of you as if you and she
were pals. Just another one of her oddities, of
course, so I let it go that way.”</p>

<p>Here was Nancy’s chance to tell Rosa why
the girl considered her friendly. But the hot
flush in her cheeks warned her. Besides, there
was in Nancy’s mind a new thought. It came
when Orilla had smiled at her in the woods.
Perhaps Nancy could help Orilla!</p>

<p>So the moment passed and the cousins continued
to bathe and bind the scratches. Rosa’s
hands were cruelly torn and, as the girls
talked, Rosa gave Nancy an inkling of the
whole absurd plot.</p>

<p>“I never expected she would ask me to chop
down trees, of course,” explained Rosa. “She
had always insisted that what I needed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
hard work. She made fun of me for being
soft, and I suppose that made me mad. At
any rate, she promised that I would lose five
pounds a week if I faithfully followed her
advice.”</p>

<p>“Five pounds a week?” repeated Nancy,
<a name="incredulously2" id="incredulously2"></a><ins title="Original has 'increduously'">incredulously</ins>.</p>

<p>“Yes. And you see, if I lost twenty pounds
in the month the folks are in Europe I would
be quite&mdash;quite slender when they came back,”
and she smiled so prettily that Nancy wondered
Why she wanted to spoil those dimples
with trimming off their scallops.</p>

<p>“And she was going to do all that&mdash;with
violent exercise?” Nancy questioned in amazement.</p>

<p>“That and&mdash;starvation.” Rosa uttered the
last word tragically. “I didn’t promise to
starve but&mdash;now, Coz, haven’t I been humble
enough? You don’t want to hear any more
of the horrible details, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to know,” continued Nancy
cautiously, “why she wanted the trees cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
down? What was she going to do with
them?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I wanted to know, too,”
Rosa said in reply. “I knew for a long time
that she had some secret scheme; you know
the night I hurt my foot we saw that she had a
hatchet in her car, but she has never told me
what the real plan was. I’ve known Orilla
since I was a baby, and I suppose I’m used to
her ways, but I must say she is secretive. And
sly! I couldn’t find out the least thing, ever,
that she didn’t want me to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think she is like that,” agreed
Nancy, thereby dismissing for a time at least
the mystery of the plot. “But what we have
got to do now is to fix up her damages. Rosa,
I do wish you would let Margot see that big
scratch. I’m no good at nursing and I don’t
want to take the responsibility&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll be as beautiful as ever in a day or two&mdash;see
if I don’t,” replied Rosa, making desperate
efforts not to wince as she poured the disinfectant
over her hands.</p>

<p>“But when Margot smells this drug store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
she’ll surely suspect,” intimated Nancy, for,
as she said, the disinfectants had made havoc
with the atmosphere of Rosa’s little dressing
room, that adjoined her bath.</p>

<p>“I’m always getting cuts on my hands,”
replied Rosa. “All I have to do is to hide the
rest of me. Margot is pretty busy now, you
know. If she hadn’t been she would have
heard old Pixley’s story. Can’t that woman
talk though?”</p>

<p>Nancy agreed that she could, and that led
to further discussion of Mrs. Pixley, Orilla,
Mrs. Rigney and some other folks that Nancy
had recently become acquainted with.</p>

<p>This was to have been the evening of the
dance at Sunset Hotel, but there was now no
possibility of the girls attending it. Not only
did Rosa’s battered condition make it impossible,
but a heavy summer storm had descended
upon the mountains, and showed no
indications of subsiding.</p>

<p>Rain, wind, thunder, lightning! The girls
watched the great spectacle from a west window,
and at times it seemed as if the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
were splitting asunder. The lightning flashed
in a solid sea of fire behind one great mountain,
and this looked indeed as if the sky were rent
and another world was breaking through.</p>

<p>Somehow the storm seemed a fitting finish
for the turbulent day that Nancy and Rosa
had just passed through, and as they watched
the display in the heavens they worried about
Orilla. Was she safely under shelter? Why
did not her mother prevent her foolish work?
And, Nancy secretly wondered, what had that
little flash of light meant which she had seen
flame up suddenly and then die out?</p>

<p>For days following this there was no sign of
Orilla nor did any word from her come to
Fernlode. But this was in no way unusual,
rather was it regarded as a good thing for
Rosa and Nancy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rigney came around occasionally,
Nancy noticed, and she was surprised to find
her a woman of intelligence. She appeared
to be on the best of terms with Margot and
the other servants at Fernlode, and this seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
to be cause for greater wonderment that Orilla
should be so antagonistic.</p>

<p>Rosa recovered quickly, as she had promised
to, and she also “reformed.” That is, she no
longer kept secret trysts with the “fat-killer,”
as she now called Orilla, although Nancy
knew that letters, messages, and even bundles
addressed to Orilla went out very privately
from Rosa’s room.</p>

<p>The arrival of a lovely white scales for
Rosa’s bath room came as a surprise one day,
but a letter from Lady Betty presently explained
it.</p>

<p>Rosa was to take long walks with Nancy, as
she had promised to do; she was also to follow
some sensible advice in the matter of diet, and
just to keep up her courage she was to watch
the scales!</p>

<p>This plan, which was really the fulfillment
of Nancy’s written suggestion to Lady Betty,
brought the dove of peace to Fernlode, in so
far as Rosa’s conduct was concerned. For in
the first week of her trial of it she actually lost
three and one half pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
“And no barked paws nor skinned shins,”
she gayly announced to everyone, including,
of course, the Durands.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you didn’t know that insistent
exercise and cut-down rations was the
real cure,” argued Nancy, reasonably enough.
“Even at grammar school, and in the lower
grades, babes, fat dimply little ones, are walking
miles to school and turning their backs on
lollipops.”</p>

<p>“But I hate to walk and I love lollipops,”
explained the shameless Rosa.</p>

<p>“And you loved the excitement of a woodland
mystery?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I could just see myself in a movie
cutting down trees and falling away into skeleton
lines. It was romantic now, Nance,
wasn’t it, really?”</p>

<p>“Very. Especially when we brought you
back on a tray. All carved up like a tatooed
injun&mdash;”</p>

<p>They yelled at this, and Nancy was so relieved
at Rosa’s change of disposition that she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Nancy, began to get fat! Just as Lady Betty
had hoped!</p>

<p>Everything was so happy and cheerful;
Rosa’s friends came almost every afternoon
and evening, numbers of them, girls and boys,
and at last the summer had opened up into a
real vacation for Nancy.</p>

<p>They finally went to a dance at Sunset
Hotel, and Rosa wore the blue cape. It was a
perfect evening and everyone was so happy
that even the sight of the cape upon Rosa’s
shoulders failed to bring regret to Nancy.
Four car loads of young folks from their summer
homes paraded down the hillside road at
nine o’clock. It seemed late to Nancy, but
she knew better than to say so.</p>

<p>“The hotel children have the ball-room
from eight until nine,” Dell had explained,
“then the young folks swarm in. Don’t worry
about being too young, Nancy. You look like
a young lady in that stunning rig.”</p>

<p>The “rig” was stunning, even Nancy conceded
that, for it was a flame-colored chiffon
robe that fell down straight from her shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
sleeveless, and with the fashionable high
neck. Her dark hair set the flame color off
beautifully, as did the glints of her dark eyes,
and she really did look lovely. This costume
was one of Lady Betty’s presents.</p>

<p>Whether a girl was fourteen or nineteen no
one could tell, for the bobbed heads were so
much alike and so ineffably youthful, everyone
looked very young indeed.</p>

<p>The hotel was fascinating to Nancy; its
great posts and pillars flanked with baskets of
growing vines, the spectacular lights set all
over the ceilings, and the music!</p>

<p>It was a scene of gaiety such as Nancy had
never before witnessed, and when Gar had
danced with her and had then taken her out
to the great porch to see the lake illuminations,
Nancy Brandon felt like a girl in a
dream. Summer life at a fashionable resort
was to her like a page from a book, or a scene
in a play.</p>

<p>“But I’d die if I had to stay at a hotel,”
Gar assured her as she commented upon the
grandeur. “It’s all right once in a while, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
you would hate this artificial living as a regular
diet.”</p>

<p>Nancy agreed that she might, but she also
expressed her interest in a sample like this.
Rosa had a wonderful time also, the best part
of it being the number of compliments she
received.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she getting thin!”</p>

<p>The dance ended early for the Durand
party, as Dell was a practical chaperon, and
she insisted upon returning to the hills at a
reasonable hour. But the memory of that
first night stayed in Nancy’s mind just as she
remembered her own little party in the Whatnot
Shop last year.</p>

<p>Only Ted and her mother had been there to
make that first one really complete.</p>

<h2><a name="xx" id="xx"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span>A SMALL BROWN BAG</span></h2>


<p>And Rosa was getting thin! In this simple,
easy, pleasant way&mdash;just long walks, daily.
That meant rain or shine and “long” meant all
the way to the village, clear down to the post
office, two miles each way. At first Rosa
objected; she found her feet untrained for
such tramps, but Nancy knew and insisted.</p>

<p>“Why not try <em>my</em> cure?” she urged. “It’s
not near as unpleasant as Orilla’s.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Rosa would sigh. “But you
better tip off the scales. If they don’t mark
me low&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They will,” Nancy promised, and of course
they always did.</p>

<p>Gar proposed tennis. Rosa had never before
played&mdash;“good reason why,” she explained,
but now she was anxious to try the
splendid summer game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
“You look wonderful in your sport suit,
Rosa,” Nancy encouraged, “and out on the
courts&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right. Anything once, but don’t expect
me to fly up in the air after the ball, the
way you do, Nance. I’m still something of a
paper weight, you know.”</p>

<p>So tennis was tried, successfully.</p>

<p>“I know what was the matter with you,
Rosa,” her cousin told her one afternoon after
an especially enjoyable set with Paul and Gar,
“you thought you were fat, and so you were
self-conscious and miserable. Now you think
you aren’t very fat, and you’re proud.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m not! I am not, am I Nancy?
Tell me quickly! End this ‘crool’ suspense&mdash;”
and Rosa performed a wonderful stunt with
tennis racket and ball, actually “flying” off
her feet in a really creditable manner.</p>

<p>She was so happy! No one who has always
been free from such an insistent worry as
Rosa’s had been, can actually understand the
joy of hope that a few pounds less flesh can
bring. The hand of that little white scale became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
a friend, an understanding friend, and
every time it pointed to a figure Rosa held her
breath.</p>

<p>But this did not solve the mystery built
around Orilla. Rosa herself was as keenly
interested in that as was Nancy, in spite of her
rescue from any actual need of it. Bit by bit
she confided in Nancy details of the queer
bargain between her and Orilla. She had
shared her allowance with her, who insisted
she had a right to some of it anyway, and that
she would not “make Rosa as thin as herself”
if she didn’t pay well for it.</p>

<p>“But what has she done with the money?”
Nancy asked, after that admission.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Rosa, innocently.
“You see, she had some big project
in her mind and everything else she could get
was supposed to go toward it.”</p>

<p>One evening when Nancy was seeking a
little solitude along the lake front, there to
read again her latest letter from her mother
and the latest “funny page” from Ted, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
was startled by someone calling her name in a
hushed, whispering voice.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she asked, although quite certain
of whom it would prove to be.</p>

<p>“I, Orilla,” came the answer, as the girl
stepped from behind the shrubbery into
Nancy’s path.</p>

<p>“Oh, how you frightened me!” Nancy exclaimed.
“I was so intent upon&mdash;my own
thoughts. How are you, Orilla? We haven’t
seen or heard of you in such a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” replied the girl, who as
usual wore the dingy suit of khaki, and a boy’s
soft hat upon her thick red hair. “I’m glad
I met you here. I want to ask a favor of
you.”</p>

<p>“All right, Orilla,” said Nancy sincerely,
“I shall be glad to help you if I can.”</p>

<p>“I believe you. You’re different. Maybe
it’s because you’re poor&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nancy smiled broadly at this, but Orilla did
not appear to notice it. She motioned to a
rustic seat and they both sat down. Nancy
was curious and a little anxious, for Orilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
while assuming friendship, still had that
queer, furtive look in her eyes, and her face
was surely unnaturally flushed.</p>

<p>“Have you been working too hard, Orilla?”
Nancy asked kindly. “You aren’t strong and
you shouldn’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m strong as an ox,” interrupted the girl.
“That’s because I live out doors. I was sick
once, and since I cured myself no one has
interfered with my ways.”</p>

<p>This, thought Nancy, must be why Orilla’s
mother allowed her to do as she pleased. But
even so, she surely might have saved her
daughter from wood chopping!</p>

<p>“Yes, I only go indoors at night&mdash;I steal in.
No one knows where I go,” this meant much
to Orilla, evidently. “But you’re my friend
and we both have a secret, so that’s what I
want to tell you.”</p>

<p>Nancy was so surprised she merely listened,
not venturing to interrupt with a single word.
Orilla kept locking and unlocking her fingers
in a nervous way, and she fidgeted in her seat
even more nervously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
As if the secret so long waited for was about
to burst over Nancy’s head, like a cloud before
a storm, she waited.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know I can trust you,” Orilla continued
after a pause. “You’re what they call
an idealist, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I am,” faltered Nancy.
“Why should I be?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re so square. I’ve read about
girls like you. They always want everything
just right, no tricks nor sneaking. I knew
that night when you tried on that cape that
you were doing something for Rosa.”</p>

<p>“Why? How did you know?”</p>

<p>“You looked it. When a girl is sneaking
she doesn’t flare up and get mad the way you
did,” went on the surprising Orilla and Nancy
knew better than to prolong the discussion by
any arguments. She merely smiled and accepted
the words as they were intended.</p>

<p>“And since then you’ve never told,” Orilla
declared, her features drawn and strained as
she talked, and her eyes shifting. “You never
told Rosa, for if you had she would have told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
me. What she knows the world knows,” said
Orilla, scornfully.</p>

<p>“But Rosa has never said anything against
you, Orilla,” spoke up Nancy. “I’m sure you
ought to give her credit for that.”</p>

<p>“There you go again. I told you you were
an idealist. But that’s all the better for me.
I can trust you, too.”</p>

<p>This sounded like trickery to Nancy, and
she said so.</p>

<p>“But you are lots older than I am and you
ought to have lots more sense,” she pointed
out. “I don’t mind helping you, if it’s something
you can’t do yourself, but I must be
loyal to my own family,” she insisted, firmly.</p>

<p>“It won’t interfere with your family, don’t
worry,” replied Orilla. “I just want you to
take care of some money for me. That’s not
so hard to do, is it?”</p>

<p>“Money!” Nancy remembered what Rosa
had said about that. “Why can’t <em>you</em> take
care of it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Because I suspect that someone knows I’ve
got it, and they’re after it.” Orilla was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
calm and composed now, and Nancy noticed
how quickly her moods changed. “It’s in
this little bag,” Orilla continued, showing to
Nancy a square, brown bag made of khaki,
just like her suit. It was bulky and seemed
to contain quite a lot of money&mdash;if it were all
money.</p>

<p>“Well, if you just want me to take it for a
few days I don’t suppose there is any harm in
that,” reasoned Nancy. “But suppose someone
stole it from me?”</p>

<p>“No one would around here, that is, not up
in your rooms,” replied Orilla. “Please take
it, Nancy. It means an awful lot to me,” and
she laid the bag on Nancy’s lap as she pleaded.</p>

<p>“All right. But don’t hold me responsible.
I’ll do the best I can to take care of it, of
course,” Nancy assured her, “but if anything
<em>does</em> happen&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It won’t. Thank you for taking it, Nancy.
Now I am free to&mdash;finish my work,” and she
stood up to leave.</p>

<p>“But, Orilla, you were going to tell me something
else; your secret place, wasn’t it?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Nancy felt now she should know more about
Orilla’s business if she were going to act as her
secret treasurer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t wait now, but meet me here
to-morrow evening at this time, and then I’ll
tell you. Good-bye, I must go. Don’t mention
having seen me,” and just as she had done
before, Orilla slipped away, back of the bushes
like a wild creature of the woods, indeed.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Nancy sat there, the
brown bag lying in her lap, an unwelcome
treasure.</p>

<p>“How queer!” she was thinking. “And
most of this was Rosa’s. But Rosa gave it to
her, so it really is Orilla’s now. Imagine my
being her&mdash;cashier!” and a little laugh escaped
from Nancy’s lips.</p>

<p>The gentle splash of a canoe paddle told of
Orilla’s departure, and Nancy checked her
thoughts to listen.</p>

<p>“She is certainly the oddest girl I have ever
met,” she reflected. “But I had no idea of
becoming a chum of hers. What would Rosa
say if she knew?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
This was not a pleasant consideration, but
somehow Nancy knew she could serve even
Rosa best by agreeing, partly, with Orilla, so
her misgivings were presently quieted.</p>

<p>Having the bag of money was certainly a
tangible link between her and Orilla, and
already Nancy understood its significance.</p>

<p>“I’d love to tell Rosa,” she pondered, “but
if I did Orilla would not trust me further, and
I know I must keep her confidence, for a while
at least. Just now Rosa is getting along so
splendidly,” she told herself, “and she’s so
relieved from her worries, that it surely must
be best to keep her out of Orilla’s affairs.”</p>

<p>The little brown bag assumed almost a live
form as Nancy clutched it. How long had
Orilla been saving all that money? Some of
it was in bills&mdash;that was easily felt through
the cloth&mdash;and much of it was in coin; the
weight vouched for that.</p>

<p>However, it was all in Nancy’s keeping
now, and she tucked it under her scarf as she
entered the house. Meeting Rosa in the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Nancy then accepted the plan for an evening
at Durand’s.</p>

<p>“Anything easy for to-night,” she replied
to Rosa’s suggestion. “I don’t feel a bit like
thinking&mdash;hard.”</p>

<h2><a name="xxi" id="xxi"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span>ENTANGLEMENTS</span></h2>


<p>A week passed and still Nancy guarded the
bag, but in that time had neither seen Orilla
nor heard from her. The girl’s promise to
meet her at the lakeside, on the evening following
that upon which she had imposed the
trust upon Nancy, had not been kept. Nancy
waited until dark, and even a little later than
she felt comfortable, out there alone away
from everyone, and at a considerable distance
from the house; but Orilla did not come.</p>

<p>Nancy imagined many reasons for her failure
to appear. Perhaps she had feared detection,
as she had the person she suspected of
being after her money. Or perhaps her
mother was keeping watch. Mrs. Rigney had
been around Fernlode almost daily in the past
week, and more than once Nancy heard her
talking to Margot, as if she were in distress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Orilla’s name was mentioned often, but Nancy
knew nothing more than that.</p>

<p>Finally, it was Rosa who broke the spell.
She burst in upon Nancy one morning before
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Nancy!” she exclaimed, “I’m just worried
to death about Orilla. There’s a reason why,
but I just can’t explain, if you don’t mind.
You’ve been such a dear, I perfectly hate to
go at things this way again,” and Rosa’s face
bore out that statement. “But if you’ll only
trust me this once more&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course I trust you, Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I knew you would. Then don’t worry
about me this morning. I’ve just got to go
off and find her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, dear, I’d rather go
alone.”</p>

<p>“But I want to go, Rosa. I’m interested
in finding her. In fact, I’ve got a reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Really! Are we both having secrets about
Orilla? That would be funny if we weren’t
so worried, wouldn’t it? But, Nancy, please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
let <em>me</em> find her and then I’ll tell <em>you</em> where she
is. I hate to seem secretive but&mdash;well, I just
have to this time.”</p>

<p>Nancy was baffled. Rosa was so positive
in wanting to go off alone. And she, Nancy,
was just as anxious to get in touch with Orilla.
Why shouldn’t they both go together?</p>

<p>“Rosa,” she began again, “I’d love to tell
you my secret, but you see I promised Orilla&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So did I,” interrupted Rosa, smiling in
spite of herself. “And, <em>you</em> see, if we both
went she would believe we both told.”</p>

<p>This sounded reasonable and Nancy hesitated.
Rosa saw her chance and pressed it
further.</p>

<p>“I’ll come back as quickly as I can,” she
promised, “and then you can go talk to her.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t had breakfast&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. I couldn’t rest. I got to
fussing and I went downstairs before even
Margot was around. Don’t worry about me,
Nancy love,” begged Rosa, pressing her
cousin’s hand impulsively. “I’ll take good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
care of myself this time, and I promise not to
cut down a single tree.”</p>

<p>“But you are not going on the lake alone?”</p>

<p>“No; a friend is going to take me in her
motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Not Dell, nor Gar?”</p>

<p>“No. But someone just as trustworthy.
You know Katherine Walters you met last
week at Durand’s? She’s a regular old sea
captain on the lake, and runs a boat like one.”</p>

<p>“I saw her out the other day, in a big green
launch&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Cucumber. That’s her boat and
that’s the one we’re going in.”</p>

<p>“Who else is going?” asked Nancy. “Why
couldn’t I sit in the boat with Katherine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If Orilla saw <em>you</em> along she would never
believe me,” persisted Rosa, a little disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we are humoring her an
awful lot, Rosa?” Nancy asked in a strained
voice; she too was bothered.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose <em>I</em> am; not you. But just
this once. You see, Nancy, Orilla hasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
much in life and she expected such a lot.”</p>

<p>“You’re good to her, Rosa, perhaps too
good. But I hope you’re not making another
mistake; you know how she influences you.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t now, Coz. I’m not in need
of her services. You see, my doctor is a resident.
I have her with me all the time,” and
again she flung her arms affectionately around
Nancy.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing to do but agree, so
after many admonitions from Nancy and
promises from Rosa, the latter started off.
She had arranged things with Margot so as to
allay her suspicions, and when Rosa waved to
Nancy from the green launch, called the Cucumber,
Nancy sighed in spite of the beautiful
morning and all other favorable circumstances.</p>

<p>Hours dragged by slowly. First Nancy
wrote letters&mdash;it would soon be time for homecomings&mdash;then
she drew a pen and ink sketch
for Ted. She even finished the little handkerchief
she was hemstitching for Manny, but
yet there remained a full half hour before
lunch time. And no sign of Rosa!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
It might have been that Nancy had not yet
gotten over that anxious search for Rosa,
when she and the Durands finally found her
on Mushroom Island, at any rate, all that
morning Nancy worried.</p>

<p>Lunch time came but Rosa did not. One,
two, three o’clock! Nancy could stand it no
longer. She made some excuse to Margot
and hurried over to Durand’s.</p>

<p>It happened that Paul was there, and, of
course, Gar was with him; but Dell had gone
out.</p>

<p>“Look for Rosa!” shouted Gar, just as she
knew he would when she told why she had
come. “Say, Nance, what is this, anyway?
A bureau of missing persons?”</p>

<p>She explained without fully explaining, and
the boys gladly enough set sail in the Whitecap,
once more to search for the illusive Rosa.</p>

<p>“But no wood carving, wood chopping, nor
wood lugging,” declared Gar, gayly. Then
he told Paul about his previous experience in
that line, embellishing the story with extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
little touches peculiar to the style of
Garfield Durand.</p>

<p>Paul and Nancy, as usual, found many
things to talk about, to discuss and even to
disagree over, for Paul proclaimed the beauties
of New Hampshire while Nancy held with
unswerving loyalty to the glories of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>But her anxiety over the delay of Rosa’s
return was not even thinly covered by these
assumed interests, and only Gar’s continual
threats to do something dreadful to the runaway
“this time sure” and his repeated avowals
that he positively, absolutely and unquestionably
would not “dig up the woods nor
chop down trees in this search,” kept Nancy’s
real worry from being mentioned.</p>

<p>“We don’t have to go on the islands to look
for the Cucumber,” Gar insisted. “The girls
couldn’t hide that boat if they tried. It’s so
green you can hear it, to say nothing of the
noise that engine makes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we don’t have to go inland at all,”
Nancy agreed with elaborate indifference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“I just wanted to look around and hurry Rosa
along. She has a way of staying over, if it’s
only to gather weeds. Rosa doesn’t seem to
worry, ever, about keeping her appointments,
but I didn’t want Margot to spoil any of our
fun, just because Rosa stayed out all day, you
see,” finished Nancy, quite confused from the
length of her speech and its utter improbability.</p>

<p>“Let’s skirt around these islands,” proposed
Paul, “and if we don’t spy the Cuke we better
try over at the Point. They may be <a name="picnicking" id="picnicking"></a><ins title="Original has 'picnicing'">picnicking</ins>.
Katherine loves the lollypops they sell at the
Point&mdash;I know.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed, Gar, “but after that I’ve
got to get back. Promised to drive down for
Dell, you know, and <em>she</em> isn’t walking off fat.”</p>

<p>They skirted the islands but did not discover
the long green boat at any landing or
out upon the lake. Then they proceeded to
navigate in the direction of the Point. Here
they encountered many boats of many descriptions,
for the Point was not only a pretty
point of land extending out into the water, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
it was also a point of recreation and general
interest for summer folk for miles around.</p>

<p>“Not here,” reported Paul, for there was no
sign of the girls, and the boat was nowhere to
be seen. “Better go back home. They could
have gone in through the cove, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course they could, and I’ll bet they
have,” declared Gar. “Well, we had a fine
sail, anyway. Hope <em>you</em> enjoyed it, Miss
Brandon?” he finished in assumed formality.</p>

<p>“Very much,” simpered Nancy imitating
Gar’s affectation. “I had been rather dull all
day, but <em>this</em>&mdash;” she swept the lake with a
broad gesture&mdash;“this is glorious.”</p>

<p>“Joking aside,” said Paul, “are you having
any fun, Nancy? That cousin of yours is as
hard to manage as a young colt, I’d say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, she isn’t, really,” replied Nancy.
“We have wonderful times now, much better
than we did at first when we didn’t understand
each other.”</p>

<p>“And you claim to understand Rosa now?”
asked Gar, swerving his boat into the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
cove that lay beside his own summer home
and Fernlode.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I think I do,” spoke up Nancy.
“But then, Rosa’s my own cousin and that
makes it easier.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s it,” retorted Gar, “because
I’m not so dreadfully stupid, I hope, yet I
can’t understand her a-tall.”</p>

<p>“Now look!” cried Paul suddenly, standing
up and pointing to Fernlode. “There they
are! What did I tell you!”</p>

<p>“That,” replied Gar, crisply, slowing down
his engine.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad,” breathed Nancy, in her
joy betraying how anxious she had been.
“But the boat is going off!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but your dear little Rosalind is all
right, standing there all by her little self.
See her?” said Gar, as usual teasing about
Rosa.</p>

<p>It took but a few moments to pull up to the
long landing, but the Cucumber had already
steamed off and, as Gar had said, Rosa stood
there, waiting alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
One look at her cousin’s face and Nancy
knew she had been disappointed. She had
not found Orilla.</p>



<div class="chapter">

</div>

<h2><a name="xxii" id="xxii"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span>A GIRL AND HER ROOM</span></h2>


<p>Nancy found Rosa, as she suspected, disappointed
and even worried.</p>

<p>“It was the strangest thing,” Rosa explained,
“every time we thought we had found
Orilla she just seemed to disappear. Of
course she didn’t, but on the lake there are so
many turns, and ins and outs and, being in the
boat, we stayed on the water. I suppose
Orilla was on land,” she finished sullenly.</p>

<p>“Why was it so important for you to see her
to-day?” Nancy asked, innocently enough.</p>

<p>“I had a message for her, and that should
have reached her to-day,” replied Rosa. But
she did not go into details and Nancy felt that
she could not question further. However, she
did try to reassure Nancy that Orilla would
probably be around before nightfall.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Rosa said, “if not, I simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
don’t know what I shall do. I went to all her
woodland haunts that <em>I</em> know of, and land
knows she’s got enough of them, but there
wasn’t even a trace to show that human footprints
had been over the ground lately. Oh,
dear, isn’t it awful to be a crank? Orilla is
just a crank, and I tell you I’m about sick of
her ways,” Rosa pouted. “But I have to get
some of the loose ends tied up before I can
wash my hands of it, as Margot would say.”</p>

<p>“And there she is,” Nancy reminded Rosa,
for at that moment Margot was coming down
the path at a brisk rate.</p>

<p>“On the war path,” Rosa remarked. “I’ve
got to surprise her with some news. Let me
see! Oh, I’ll tell her about a big sale of linens
down at Daws,” and forthwith Rosa rushed
up the path to proclaim the glad tidings to the
unsuspecting Margot&mdash;or the Margot who
was pretending to be unsuspecting.</p>

<p>From that moment until after dinner and
until almost nightfall, the cousins had not a
moment to themselves, for company came,
and Rosa had to entertain. Nancy also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
helped out, the visitors being most interested
in her simple reports from the neighboring
state. When they were leaving (they were
the Drydens from the Weirs and were staying
at a hotel in Craggy Bluff) Rosa drove in town
with them to bring some mail to the post
office, but Nancy declined to go. Rosa was
to meet Dell Durand and drive back with her,
and as Dell had talked to Nancy on the phone
and assured her she would be back before dark
(all this in coaxing Nancy to go), there seemed
no danger of delay for Rosa.</p>

<p>When they had all gone Nancy felt herself
free at last to take her favorite stroll along the
lake front. The sunset was glorious; golds,
purples, greens and ashes of roses, in hues too
brilliant to be so tersely described. Is there
anything which can beggar description as can
a sunset on that great, majestic lake! Words
cannot tell of it, no more than the mist can
veil it.</p>

<p>“It looks as if heaven were leaking joy,”
thought Nancy, as she watched the descending
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Thinking of her mother, of Ted and of dear
Manny, as she did every evening, this being a
part of her filial love and devotion, Nancy
gazed and wondered, until suddenly a step
near her startled her from her reverie.</p>

<p>It was Orilla!</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Nancy. “I didn’t see you
coming&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, one can’t. I have so many secret
little paths around here,” spoke Orilla, and
Nancy noticed that her voice was very low,
subdued, and her words rather well chosen.</p>

<p>“But I’m so glad you came,” Nancy hurried
to add. “We’ve been looking everywhere
for you, all day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been away, to the city, and I’m so
tired!” With a sigh she sank down upon the
lake-side bench. “I believe I would die if I
had to live in a city,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“It is dreadfully stuffy after air like this,”
agreed Nancy. “But you are not sick, are
you, Orilla?” she asked anxiously, for Orilla
did seem very unlike herself.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. I have an awful headache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
but&mdash;don’t let us talk about sickness,”
Orilla broke off suddenly. “I have something
more important to talk of to-night.”</p>

<p>“First, Orilla,” interrupted Nancy, “won’t
you please let me give you your little bag? It
has worried me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you’ll only keep it a few more days,
Nancy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But why? Shouldn’t your mother take
care of it for you?” questioned Nancy. She
had been determined to get rid of the treasure
and this was her chance.</p>

<p>“Mother?” Orilla’s voice showed disapproval
of that idea, most emphatically. “No,
mother is good and has given me much freedom,
but she doesn’t quite understand me,
you see, Nancy,” finished the girl with one
more of those weary, heavy sighs.</p>

<p>Before Nancy could speak again Orilla had
risen and was leading the way to the other end
of the spacious grounds.</p>

<p>“Come this way,” she said. “We won’t
meet anybody and I must not delay too
long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
“But Rosa may be along&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you alone, Nancy, please,”
pleaded Orilla. “Then you may tell Rosa if
you want to. I’m tired of secrets, tired of
being hated and tired of fighting. Until you
showed some friendliness for me, I haven’t
ever remembered kindness except from
mother, and, well, just a few others,” finished
Orilla, evasively.</p>

<p>She was hurrying toward the rear of the big
house and Nancy was following. The path
she picked out was quite new to Nancy, who
thought she had discovered every little nook
and corner of the big summer place, but this
was a mere strip of clearance, tunneled in
under heavy wild grape vines that grew
clamorously over high and low shrubbery,
and even climbed into the biggest wild cherry
tree.</p>

<p>Neither girl spoke for some minutes. Then
Orilla asked Nancy if she liked Fernlode.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” Nancy replied, “I love it.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” declared Orilla sharply, “and you
know they&mdash;put me out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
“Oh, no, Orilla, they didn’t do that,”
Nancy hurried to correct her. “When Uncle
Frederic married&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know all that, Nancy, but don’t let’s talk
of it. It makes me furious, even now. Don’t
talk any more&mdash;some one might hear us. Just
come quietly after me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Where could she be leading her, Nancy
wondered? Surely this was the end of the
house just back of the servant’s dining room&mdash;</p>

<p>Orilla stepped up to the corner of the building,
and then Nancy saw that they faced a
small door. It was situated at the extreme
end of the first floor and almost hidden in
heavy shrubbery. While Nancy waited,
Orilla surprised her still further by taking a
key from her dress and turning it in the lock.</p>

<p>The door opened!</p>

<p>“Orilla!”</p>

<p>“Hush! Just keep close,” whispered the
girl. “It is only dark at the entrance.”</p>

<p>By keeping close Nancy soon found herself
in a quarter of Fernlode she had never before
explored. She knew that it must be the servants’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
quarters, and before she could speculate
further, Orilla had unlocked another door and
they both found themselves in a pleasant little
room!</p>

<p>“This is&mdash;my&mdash;room!”</p>

<p>Nancy could scarcely breathe, she was so
frightened at the tone in which Orilla said
that.</p>

<p>Her room!</p>

<p>“You see, these are all my things, and I
come here whenever I get a chance,” Orilla
confessed. “No one ever thinks of looking
in here, and I never take anything away. I
wouldn’t do that, you know,” she said very
positively, as if fearing Nancy’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Your&mdash;room!” Nancy was too surprised
to get past that unbelievable statement.</p>

<p>“Yes; and no one else cares for it or needs
it.” Orilla was straightening around the
brown reed chairs and patting the small table
cover, and as she touched a thing, her affectionate
interest in it was plain even to Nancy’s
excited gaze.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Rosa know?” Nancy asked finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
“No. Rosa has been away a lot, you know,
and besides, the Fernells only come here in
summer. I was born in these mountains, and
as a child mother brought me here. She’s a
nurse, you know, and a wonderful mother.”
Orilla sat down and pointed out a chair to
Nancy, which the latter gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Nancy knew little about Mrs. Rigney, but
she guessed now that probably her love for
Orilla had led her into the mistake of allowing
her daughter to grow up believing Fernlode to
be her own home.</p>

<p>As if divining Nancy’s thoughts, Orilla said
almost that very thing.</p>

<p>“Mother was devoted to the real Mrs.
Fernell,” she said, thereby disputing Lady
Betty’s later claim, “and Mrs. Fernell was
lovely to me. While Rosa was away at school
I played around here as&mdash;well&mdash;you can imagine
how I felt to be put out of <em>this</em> room!”
she again challenged.</p>

<p>In vain did Nancy try to explain the situation,
defending Lady Betty’s purpose in keeping
no one but servants on Fernlode, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Orilla would not be convinced of its justice.
Suddenly she threw herself upon the bed with
such secret enjoyment, that Nancy knew the
girl’s mind had become morbid on the subject
of ownership.</p>

<p>As so often happens with those who are
physically delicate, her reasoning also was at
fault. She imagined she had been unjustly
treated, whereas nothing of the sort had happened.
Mr. Fernell had been generous to the
point of bounty in educating Orilla and in
giving a sum of money to the mother. This
had all been done because of Mrs. Rigney’s
devotion to Nancy’s Aunt Katherine, the first
Mrs. Fernell, and Nancy knew the story well.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Orilla began again, “it was not
mother’s fault. And she has tried to make
me see things her way; but I can’t. I’ve
always been a wild mountain girl and all that
I’ve loved has been here. You don’t think I
did wrong to come back here once in a while,
do you?” she asked plaintively.</p>

<p>Nancy gazed silently at the girl upon the
bed. Her hair, always so fiery red, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
look quite so peculiar on that pillow&mdash;Orilla’s
own pillow, that she had so long loved. The
room was musty and needed a thorough airing,
but Nancy noticed a small casement window
opened slightly&mdash;this was, she reasoned,
Orilla’s way of secretly ventilating the room.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what could be very wrong about
your coming here,” Nancy finally answered
Orilla’s question. “But why didn’t you ask?”</p>

<p>“Ask? After being turned away?”</p>

<p>“You were not turned away, Orilla, and
that’s a foolish thing to say. Uncle Frederic
simply changed his plans and there was no
need of a nurse here,” stoutly and emphatically
proclaimed Nancy.</p>

<p>“And they didn’t like me to be with Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, Orilla, you can’t deny you were not
a suitable companion for Rosa, because you
could make her do anything. You are older,
and you worked on her sympathies,” Nancy
felt obliged to point out.</p>

<p>“I’ll admit that now, Nancy, to you, but it
didn’t seem that way before. I never told
anyone, not even mother, how I felt, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
just all piled up inside of me until I imagined
myself like a volcano, always ready to&mdash;erupt.”</p>

<p>This was the first time that Nancy had
noticed any depth to Orilla’s character, and
she had continually wondered where the educational
influences, said to have been provided
by her uncle, had been hidden in the girl’s
personality. But the confession of her morbid,
morose state of mind was plainly the
answer. She had fought down culture, choosing
to be simply a wild girl of the mountains.</p>

<p>“My mother always insists upon us talking
things out,” said Nancy quietly. “It’s so
much better to share our worries&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know that now. I feel like a different
girl, just from talking to you, and you’re only
a kid,” said Orilla, again betraying her disregard
of polite English. “I’m through with
secrets, Nancy,” she continued, jumping up
suddenly from the bed, with evident nervousness.
“One secret leads to another until I am
fairly smothered in them. Now, this one is
not so heavy, but there&mdash;are&mdash;more.”</p>

<span>SHEDDING SECRETS</span></h2>


<p>Orilla was now moving about the room in
such an excited manner that Nancy became
alarmed!</p>

<p>“Come on out, Orilla,” she begged. “I
really have stayed too long. Rosa will be
back&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s go. But I want to tell
you that I broke the fern stand&mdash;Mrs. Betty’s,
you know,” Orilla said, her voice raising beyond
the pitch of security. “I came back that
night&mdash;mother was to be away a week and I
came up here for that one night&mdash;and I had
forgotten my key. I was so mad to have to
go back home all alone and it was late, you
know, that I just Smashed that fancy stand
for revenge!”</p>

<p>“Orilla! That lovely fernery!” gasped
Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
“Yes, I know it does seem cowardly,” admitted
the girl, “but my head was splitting&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have a headache now,” interrupted
Nancy, noting again the girl’s highly flushed
face.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I must go,” she cast a lingering
look about the room, which really was quite
cozy. “How I would love to be able to come
in here and fix things up,” she sighed.</p>

<p>Nancy was thinking of a possible plan, but
she had no time to mention it now. She
wanted to get outside and find Rosa.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m going to tell Rosa,” she said,
making sure of speaking positively so that
Orilla would not expect to object.</p>

<p>“I suppose you can. I am so tired of secrets
that I was determined to tell you before
my old crankiness would come over me again,”
confessed Orilla. She had locked the door and
again they were treading their way under the
wild grape-vine tunnel. “I don’t know why
it is that some people can soothe one so. I
should never have thought of confiding in anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
else, and yet you’re just a little girl,”
reasoned Orilla wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s it,” replied Nancy brightly.
“Because I’m little&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. That isn’t all of it, but you
wouldn’t care for soft soap,” said Orilla wistfully.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hear Rosa&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I must go, Nancy. My head is bursting,
and if I get talking to Rosa, she’ll say so
much&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know she has been looking for you all
day,” persisted Nancy, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. Everything has got to
wait&mdash;until to-morrow. Tell her I’ll be here
in the morning&mdash;if I’m able&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orilla, I can’t let you go,” interposed
Nancy. “I’m afraid you’re sick&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not, really. I have these headaches
often, and bringing you into my room,
you see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” said Nancy kindly.
“And if you feel that perhaps, as you say, you
had better get quiet. All right; I’ll tell Rosa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Don’t worry that she’ll find fault; she always
speaks well of you, Orilla.”</p>

<p>“Yes, little Rosa’s all right, but silly. She
was so ashamed of being fat&mdash;why&mdash;” and a
little laugh escaped Orilla’s lips. “Wasn’t
she foolish?”</p>

<p>Nancy heard voices from the roadway just
as Orilla slipped into her boat and paddled off.
Finding the secret room had been such a sudden
revelation that Nancy could scarcely understand
it all even yet. That Orilla should
have so loved that room, and that she had been
coming to it secretly for so long a time, seemed
incredible.</p>

<p>“Uncle Frederic would have let her have it,
I’m sure,” Nancy reasoned, “and <em>I’m</em> going to
ask him to,” she determined, when the unmistakable
voice of Rosa floated in through
the hedge.</p>

<p>It was going to be exciting, Nancy knew,
this news to Rosa. It would surely be met
with one of Rosa’s typical outbursts, so she
decided to postpone the telling until Rosa was
safely, if not quietly, indoors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
“Drydens want us to come to their hotel
some night,” Rosa reported, “and we must go.
Nancy, they think I’m thin enough. What
do you think of that?” and Rosa took a look
in the mirror to help Nancy’s answer.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Rosa,” said Nancy importantly.
“I’ve got such news&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orilla been here?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And she’s gone? Why didn’t you chain
her till I came&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, Rosa, she had a dreadful headache&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Headache! What’s that to the trouble
I’ve got? Her troubles, I mean,” and Rosa
fell into a chair as if in despair.</p>

<p>“Do let me tell you, Rosa. I feel a little
done up myself.”</p>

<p>“Selfish me, as usual. Go ahead, Coz.
I’ve got my fingers crossed and am gripping
both arms of the chair. No, that’s a physical
impossibility; but I’ve got my feet crossed, so
it’s all the same. Now please&mdash;tell!”</p>

<p>“Did you have any idea that Orilla came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
her room here, in this house?” Nancy began
in her direct way.</p>

<p>“Her room? In this house? What do you
mean? She hasn’t any room here!”</p>

<p>“I mean the room she had before Betty
came&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That little first floor corner&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, behind the storeroom, down by the
west wing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I knew there was a corner of the house
there, but it’s been shut up for ages,” replied
Rosa, already showing her eagerness to hear
all of the story.</p>

<p>“Well, poor Orilla could never give up that
room, and she has been coming to it every
chance she got. She took me in there to-night
and I never saw anything so pathetic,”
explained Nancy simply. “She fairly loves
the room and insists that it should still be
hers.”</p>

<p>“Can you&mdash;beat&mdash;that!” Rosa was so surprised
no other wording seemed strong enough
for her. “Coming to that little cubby-hole!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Say, Nancy, honestly, do you think that
Orilla’s crazy?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. But I’ve heard mother tell
of such cases. And I’ve read about girls keeping
their baby loves, old dolls, you know, and
things like that. But this is the oddest&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For mercy sakes! How ever did she manage
it?” Rosa asked, blinking hard to see
through the surprising tale.</p>

<p>Then Nancy told her, as well as she could,
how Orilla came by the elderberry path, from
the lake, through the maze of wild grape vines
to the small door of the small porch at the
west end of the big rambling house.</p>

<p>“I always said,” put in Rosa, “that there
was a door for each servant around this house,
but I must have missed that one. Well, poor
old Orilla! I guess she’s quite a wreck, isn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“She had a headache, as I told you, but she
seemed glad to get rid of some of her secrets,
and I don’t wonder,” admitted Nancy. “She
has enough secrets to make a book. But I
told her <em>I</em> wasn’t going to keep any more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
them. I told her I was going to tell <em>you</em>
everything she told <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“Goody for you!” chanted Rosa. “And go
ahead&mdash;tell.”</p>

<p>“Well, she asked me not to tell you when
she had been here one night,” began Nancy,
taking another chair for a fresh start in the
narrative. “I didn’t then, as it couldn’t make
much difference&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She came sneaking in here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She came through the hall the night the
things came from Boston,” went on Nancy.
“And I might just as well tell you all about
it.”</p>

<p>“All?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was standing right over there trying
on the blue cape&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nancy! You liked that cape!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I like the red one&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t. I know now. That cape was
intended for you and I’m a greedy thing to
have grabbed it. Of course, <em>you</em> wouldn’t
even hint&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nancy was a little confused now. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
never expected the blue cape issue to come up
again. But Rosa was positive and would not
listen to Nancy’s protests.</p>

<p>“But, Rosa,” Nancy insisted, “Betty said
she would love to get things for you if you
would only let her. And surely, when you
admired the cape&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know. You being Nancy, and
all that,” said Rosa, meaningly. “Well, <em>I’ll</em>
forgive you. You did succeed in getting me to
listen to reason and now I’ll try to be civil to
Betty.”</p>

<p>“You would have been, anyhow,” said
Nancy. “Because you were bound to be more
reasonable&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not trying to compliment you, little
dear, so don’t try so desperately hard to shut
me off. But all the same, look&mdash;look at my
figger! Ain’t it just grand!” and Rosa strutted
again before the patient mirror making
sure doubly sure that she was quite genteel.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll think I’m complimenting
you if I tell you how well you look,” retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Nancy. “But I’m sure you have gone down
twenty pounds!”</p>

<p>“And a half,” flashed Rosa. “Twenty and
one-half pounds less, and my clothes are falling
off me. Won’t dad and Betty howl?”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got to keep up your walking,
your tennis and non-candy schedule,” Nancy
reminded her. “Don’t forget that. All right,
don’t answer, please, I have heaps more to tell
you about Orilla and we’re miles off the track.”</p>

<p>“My turn. I’ve get to tell now; you listen.
First about the blue cape. You’ve got to have
that. No, don’t object,” as Nancy seemed
about to do so. “I feel like a thief now. To
have taken that from you,” declared Rosa.</p>

<p>“I wish you would keep it. Just to show
Betty how you liked her choice,” Nancy argued.</p>

<p>“I won’t. I care more about your choice.
Besides, I can wear something else she bought,
so don’t worry. But about Orilla. You said
she had let down the bars on all secrets? That
we can tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she agreed <em>I</em> could,” replied Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
“Then that’s good enough for me,” decided
Rosa. “Now you sit pretty and listen, but
don’t faint. The reason I tried so desperately
hard to find her to-day was because I had
a message from Boston for her. Her fresh air
kids are arriving to-morrow,” said Rosa facetiously,
drawing a funny face.</p>

<p>“Fresh air&mdash;children!” corrected Nancy.
“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that the wily Orilla has made arrangements
to entertain some poor children
and their caretaker at a camp that she hasn’t
got. She thought she would have it&mdash;I suppose
that was what I was chopping down trees
for&mdash;but the camp doesn’t seem to have developed.
And those children leave Boston <em>early</em>
in the morning!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Orilla agreed to take
children at a camp out here and now they are
coming&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And the camp isn’t. That’s
the little fix <em>I’m</em> in.”</p>

<p>“You’re in?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I got her mail and it came here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
my name. It didn’t seem much to do for her,
but I’d like to know how I’m going to forestall
those children, who will leave their humble
homes with their breakfasts in shoe boxes to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>Rosa’s mood was happy and her expressions
flippant, but for all that Nancy knew she
intended no disrespect to the strange children.</p>

<p>“You mean they expect to come to Fernlode?”
Nancy queried, puzzled anew.</p>

<p>“They seem to; although, land knows, I
didn’t expect them to. You see, Orilla
couldn’t give up the idea of this being her
headquarters and I, poor dumb-bell, just
helped her carry it along.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no harm done,” said Nancy
calmly.</p>

<p>“No harm done! Wait till I get you to read
that telegram. There, read it and&mdash;rejoice!”</p>

<p>Nancy read the message. It stated that
the children, a dozen of them, would arrive at
Craggy Bluff on the morning train and directed
the recipient of the message to be sure
to meet them with cars!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
“Oh,” said Nancy. “That is rather complicated,
isn’t it, for it’s addressed to you?”</p>

<p>“Bet your life it is,” flashed Rosa. “And
please tell me quickly, pretty maiden, and all
that, what’s a girl to do about it?”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose Orilla has the camp
ready?”</p>

<p>“I know she hasn’t. She sent message
after message, or I did for her, to keep them
back. But now they’re coming to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Then, let them come, that’s all,” said
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Yes, just like that,” Rosa continued to
joke.</p>

<p>“We can take care of them. It will be fun.”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> can?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Why not? They’re just like
any other children. In fact, mother thinks
they’re always more natural and interesting
when they come to the library.”</p>

<p>Rosa simply stared. Her big blue eyes
were indeed lovely now in her pretty round
face, which had lost the flesh which before had
all but disfigured it. Her “figger,” as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
termed her form, was also much more shapely
than it had been in early summer, for magical
as the result of her simple new living rules
really were, there was no denying its reality.
Nancy was watching her now with undisguised
admiration.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repeated, “it will be fun, and we
can get Durand’s car&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nancy, I know!” almost screamed
Rosa, “we’ll have them here and say they
were entertained by Betty, by Mrs. Frederic
Fernell! Betty adores that sort of thing and
why shouldn’t we do it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to, I guess,” said Nancy dryly,
“so just come along and prepare Margot.”</p>

<h2><a name="xxiv" id="xxiv"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span>A REAL HOLIDAY</span></h2>


<p>It was amazing how everyone joined in preparing
for those children.</p>

<p>“It’s so much better fun than just having
an ordinary party,” Rosa remarked, as she
and Nancy folded the paper napkins, “because
in doing this we are doing something worth
while, and just a party is&mdash;only a party,” she
deduced in her own naive way.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Nancy, “this is more than a
party; it’s a picnic. And isn’t Margot lovely
about it?”</p>

<p>“She’s going to have the best fun of any of
us, for Margot loves children, especially
strange children,” Rosa said, slyly.</p>

<p>“If only we could get Orilla to come,”
Nancy continued, “but her mother was away
all night and when she reached home this
morning Orilla had gone out. I didn’t have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
chance to tell you that, Rosa,” said her cousin.
“You were so busy with the baker boy when I
got back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you wouldn’t locate Orilla. It
takes more than a little hunting to do that.
She flits around like a squirrel,” replied Rosa.
“But I’m not worrying about her. We have
enough on our own hands now,” and she proceeded
to count and classify the paper plates.</p>

<p>“But she promised to come and she did
seem so dreadfully upset last night,” Nancy
insisted upon saying. “I’m glad our party
will be over early this afternoon. Directly
after they leave we must go tell Orilla about
the room. I can hardly wait, can you?”</p>

<p>“That was a great idea of yours, Nancy, and
so simple. If we had waited to ask Betty and
Dad as I thought of doing it would have been
ages before we got our answer. But you
asked Margot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Margot is in charge here. There always
has to be someone in charge of every place.”</p>

<p>“So simple when you think; but I don’t always
think,” laughed Rosa. “Won’t Orilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
be tickled? And why on earth shouldn’t she
use that old room since it means so much to
her?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll behave, Rosa,” Nancy ventured.
“You are not like Orilla, you know; <em>you</em> have
everything.”</p>

<p>“But sense, and you’ve got the family supply
of that.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t go offending me,” warned
Nancy. They had little time for this conversation
and it was being pretty well mixed up
with paper plates and napkins. “You know
how unpopular a smart girl is, Rosa,” and
Nancy dropped her big dark eyes with something
like a suspicious blinking.</p>

<p>“Ye-ah, all right, you’re a dumb-bell, if you
like that better, but I don’t know what I’m
saying. I can’t think of a thing but children.
What do you suppose they’ll do and say?
Think they ever saw a mountain house before?”</p>

<p>“Why, Rosa? How absurd. They’re just
like any other children, only not so well off.
Maybe they’ll know more about mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
houses than we do,” said Nancy, indignantly.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Maybe they go on excursions
every week,” contributed Rosa. They were
ready now to wash up and go to meet the train.</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely they go often, because there’s
such a lot of them to pass the trips around to,”
Nancy reasoned out.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” ejaculated Rosa. “How you can
think!”</p>

<p>“But please don’t call me smart, remember
how I hate that,” again came the warning.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you. Smart girls are a pest
and, as you say, unpopular,” replied Rosa.
“That’s one blessing in <em>my</em> favor. But don’t
let’s fight about it,” concluded Rosa. “Hurry
along. We’ve got to get three cars, you
know.”</p>

<p>The two girls were wearing their simplest
frocks, out of consideration for the coming
visitors, but Nancy in her candy-stripe with
the red bindings and red belt, and Rosa in her
blue chambray, to match her eyes, looked
pretty enough and well dressed enough for any
picnic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
The bustle and excitement into which Fernlode
had been thrown by the girls’ sudden resolve,
to take over what should have been
Orilla’s party, was little short of that which
goes to make up “a swell affair,” as Thomas
the butler expressed it, when he insisted upon
using the tea carts on the lawn. He knew, he
pointed out, how the Fernells did things, and
that was the way they were going to be done
this time.</p>

<p>Margot claimed that she also knew something
of the Fernlode prestige, so she insisted
upon a number of things, among them being
favors for each guest. These were substantial,
as she said, being a half dozen handkerchiefs
in a pretty pictured box for each of the
twelve children to be entertained.</p>

<p>“And if there’s more girls than boys I suppose
you and I, Nancy, will have to chip in
our best hankies to make up the right kind,”
cryptically stated Rosa. To which suggestion
Nancy merely groaned.</p>

<p>Altogether “the help” as well as the hostesses
were enjoying the preparations, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the girls were racing off to meet the train.</p>

<p>There came, first, the Fernell big open
touring car, which Chet the chauffeur drove,
then the town car with the three seats which
Gar drove, and Dell Durand drove their own
touring car, so that provided plenty of room,
surely. Two cars would have been ample, but
Rosa was afraid “an extra batch” might come,
and it would have been dreadful not to have
had room enough.</p>

<p>It was really queer to be expecting strangers
and not even to know what they would look
like, but when the train pulled in, and the
conductor began handing children down from
the cars, both Rosa and Nancy were too excited
to care what they looked like.</p>

<p>Both girls, with Dell, pushed their way to
the platform and claimed as many of the
youngsters as could be lined up before them.</p>

<p>“I’m Miss Geary,” announced the pleasant,
stately, middle-aged woman who was in charge
of the outing, “and I suppose,” she said to
Dell, “you are Miss Rigney.”</p>

<p>“Miss Rigney is ill,” Dell quickly replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
“but this is Rosalind Fernell and this is Nancy
Brandon, both of Fernlode. I’m their neighbor
and chaperon,” Dell continued in her easy
social way. “We’ll all do what we can to give
you a happy time,” she promised brightly.</p>

<p>There was no need for further formalities,
and if there had been the girls would have just
as completely overlooked the need, for Nancy
was trailing off with a quartette of the children,
two girls and two boys, while Rosa
piloted three girls and one boy. Dell was
made custodian of a pair of the “darlingest
twinnies,” two little girls in blue, and there
were also with the party three older girls who
assisted Miss Geary.</p>

<p>To attempt to describe a children’s picnic
would be as futile an undertaking as trying to
describe childhood itself, for every moment
and each hour something so new and novel
developed, in the way of fun and good times,
that even a picture of a period in the merry-making
failed to record its actual happy spirit.</p>

<p>“And imagine!” babbled Rosa, while she
spilled a whole dish of ice cream by allowing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
to slip smoothly off the paper plate, “just
imagine a photographer making a picture to
be published! Did you notice, Nancy,” and
she placed a neat pile of dry leaves over the
crest-fallen ice cream, “how I looked? Did I
look&mdash;thin?”</p>

<p>“You looked so happy surrounded by your
flock,” Nancy assured her, “that weight
couldn’t count. There, call that curly-head.
She hasn’t had a balloon of her own yet and
she’s exploded a half dozen of them. Give
her one, Rosa, and tell her&mdash;<em>that’s all!</em>”</p>

<p>They were <a name="picnicking2" id="picnicking2"></a><ins title="Original has 'picnicing'">picnicking</ins> and <a name="frolicking" id="frolicking"></a><ins title="Original has 'frolicing'">frolicking</ins> around
stately old Fernlode, and the sight was such a
pleasant one that numbers of cars were drawn
up, while their occupants witnessed the festivities.</p>

<p>“All our neighbors!” exclaimed Nancy.
“There’s the Pickerings. Let Thomas bring
them cream&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And they’ll tell Betty! There’s the Gormans!
Oh, Nancy, why don’t we have a big
folks party, too?” proposed the over-joyed
Rosa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
“No, we couldn’t. That would spoil this,”
Nancy pointed out, having a mind to correct
standards. “We must do all we can to have
this go off well, and that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will be plenty,” agreed Rosa, steering her
tea cart of “empties” (the glasses, cups and
real dishes) along the driveway toward the
house.</p>

<p>Miss Geary and Dell found each other mutually
attractive, their taste for work among
children being alike, so that they not only
took care of the little ones but had an exceptionally
fine time doing so.</p>

<p>“Just look at Margot’s face. She hasn’t
room for all the smiles,” Nancy took time to
say to Rosa. She was on the lemonade staff
and Thomas, the butler, had made the drink
pink, “just to make the young ones think of a
circus,” he explained. That may have accounted
for the rush at Nancy’s booth, a
kitchen table draped with the ends of the
vines that formed a canopy above.</p>

<p>At the moment Margot was trying to carry
a huge plate of chocolate cake in one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
and with the other help little Michael, age
five, to navigate toward Nancy’s lemonade
stand. He had a lollypop in each of his hands,
so the leadership was rather difficult to carry
out.</p>

<p>How they romped, shouted, sang, cheered
and even choked! For the bounty provided
this day’s outing was plentiful to the point of
extravagance.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we take them on the lake?”
pleaded Rosa again, that offer having been
politely refused by Miss Geary a short time
before.</p>

<p>“Too risky!” replied Nancy. “But look
down at the landing! There are the twinnies
all alone!”</p>

<p>“And they’re too near the edge,” joined in
Rosa. “I thought those big girls were watching
them. Let’s run! They’ll topple over&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Nancy and Rosa were on their way.
The twinnies were in danger and the lake was
deep at that point. Innocently the little tots,
hand in hand, gazed upon the dazzling water.
They seemed fascinated, watching something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
“A flish! A flish!” shrilled little Molly, the
fairest of the fair twins.</p>

<p>Then her sister Mattie leaned over&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh!” screamed Nancy. “She’s in!”</p>

<p>“It’s deep,” Rosa warned, seeing Nancy
toss off her sweater. But the next moment
Nancy jumped into the water and before anyone
knew that little Mattie had fallen in, she
was promptly fished out! Wet and somewhat
scared, the child clung to her rescuer, who
easily brought her to shore. It was no trouble
at all for Nancy.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s the photographer!” joyfully
called out Rosa, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>Nancy had to have her picture taken,
standing on the end of the landing, with her
dripping little friend in her arms. The photographer
would call it, he said, “a prompt
rescue.”</p>

<p>This brought the entire picnic down to the
water’s edge, and the usual accident had presently
been successfully disposed of. There
were other incidents, many of them, but they
did not prevent the day from drawing to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
close. Shadows hovered threateningly near
when Margot and Thomas passed around the
favors, those pretty handkerchiefs, and the
ride back to the station was soon marked as
the final treat.</p>

<p>Nancy had changed into a fresh outfit and
little Mattie was made happy in the smallest
dress that could be borrowed in the neighborhood,
prettier than the one she wore before
the wetting, which made up for everything to
Mattie.</p>

<p>It had been wonderful, that day in all the
summer for the Fernlode folks, but Rosa and
Nancy had not forgotten Orilla.</p>

<p>“We can go directly from the train to her
mother’s,” Nancy proposed, as they neared
the station. “I have a feeling that something
is really wrong with Orilla.”</p>

<p>“Because she was sick last night?” Rosa
asked. They were presently piling the children
in the cars and had little chance to talk.</p>

<p>“That and&mdash;you know she said she would be
here to-day if she were able,” Nancy made opportunity
to answer. “And I know she meant
to keep her word.”</p>

<h2><a name="xxv" id="xxv"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span>FANTASY</span></h2>


<p>Summer was almost over. It had passed
quickly for Nancy, although at first her visit
had threatened to be dull, monotonous and
even a little unpleasant. But as soon as the
conflict between Rosa and Orilla became of
concern to her, just so promptly did her own
days at Fernlode become absorbingly interesting.</p>

<p>Rosa’s worry over a few extra pounds of fat
now seemed simply babyish, but so it is with
most personal appearance worries. They may
mean much to a sensitive girl, but to others
they are usually accepted as they should be,
as matters of small importance. It is character
that always matters most.</p>

<p>All this was clear to Rosa finally, and with it
had come the lesson in self-restraint: no candy,
the lesson in self-discipline: long walks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the lesson in common sense: to be sincere.
All of which had developed a surprisingly attractive
Rosa, and in her laudable cousin’s
efforts Nancy had enjoyed an active and interesting
part.</p>

<p>It had been thrilling&mdash;those hunts on the
islands, those escapades of Rosa’s&mdash;and it had
been fun when the worry was over. As Nancy
repeatedly insisted she would not be called
smart, because she wasn’t any smarter than
most girls; it was simply because Rosa had
been so oddly different that Nancy’s plain
common sense shone forth.</p>

<p>The cousins now were affectionate chums
indeed, for trouble and trials often bring forth
the brightest flowers of true affection, especially
where these troubles do not interfere
with the rights of others and are strictly matters
which belong in a girl’s world.</p>

<p>Having the little picnic proved a welcome
change, and its success was marked by many
pleasant memories of the children’s lovely
time, besides the pleasure the report of the
affair was sure to bring to Lady Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
There remained now but one more problem
for the young girls to solve: they must reach
Orilla and tell her that Margot had agreed to
let her use her old room, under the grape vines,
so that she would no longer be compelled to
steal in and snatch a few precious moments in
her coveted sanctuary.</p>

<p>But where to find Orilla?</p>

<p>Leaving the station Dell drove the smallest
of the fleet of cars, with Nancy and Rosa, to
hunt for the girl. Inquiring at Mrs. Rigney’s
they found Orilla’s mother in great distress.</p>

<p>“Something must have happened,” she
wailed. “Orilla has not been home to-day
and I’ve even had the little boys and girls
searching the woods for her. Where can she
have gone? Do you girls know anything
about her?” she implored, excitedly.</p>

<p>Nancy did not say that she too had expected
to see Orilla, but the three girls assured
the worried mother that they surely would
locate her daughter, and once more they faced
that almost continuous task of searching the
woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Driving through the woodland roads at the
rear of the lake front, was by no means as easy
as sailing on its smooth waters, but this was
the way the girls were now compelled to go.</p>

<p>“Those logs she cut down must have been
for something,” Dell reasoned. “Have either
of you found out what she did with those?”</p>

<p>“She intended to build a camp,” Rosa answered,
“but I don’t know where. She was
as secretive as a&mdash;fox.”</p>

<p>“She told me too she had a place in the
woods, and spoke of loving the wilderness so
much, but she never said anything to me about
where it was,” Nancy also explained.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll drive along toward Weirs,”
Dell suggested. “But we can’t expect to get
out onto the islands from the land side.”</p>

<p>Thus they journeyed in the late afternoon,
over the rough hills, up and down, in and out,
but among the camps picked out along the
road, where summer folks had pitched their
tents, no sign of Orilla was discovered.</p>

<p>“Could we hire a boat here at this landing
and go along the water front?” Nancy suggested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
“I feel we must have been near her
place that afternoon we helped with the little
trees.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could do that,” agreed Dell. It
was rather late for sailing parties, and the man
in the sailor’s uniform literally jumped at the
chance of taking them on his power boat.</p>

<p>“I believe she is on that island over there,”
pointed out Nancy, “because when we were
on the water that afternoon, I saw a flash of
light in that clump of low pines.”</p>

<p>“A clue!” sang out Rosa gayly. “Depend
upon Nancy to notice things. Tell the man
to steer in there, Dell. And let’s hope for the
best.”</p>

<p>Like the other islands this was small in area;
and as the girls jumped ashore the boatman
took out his “picture-paper” to look that over
while he waited, for they all knew the search
would take but a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s been here,” declared Rosa,
almost as soon as she had stepped on land.
“See these bushes? They’ve just been trampled
down&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
“Here’s a regular path,” interrupted Nancy.
“And see all these pieces of paper.”</p>

<p>“We are certainly on the trail,” agreed Dell.
“Nancy, we’ll follow you; this was your clue,
you know,” she pointed out tersely.</p>

<p>Quietly they followed Nancy. The little
path was leading some place, certainly, for it
was marked out clearly in the heavy grass and
undergrowth.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nancy stopped. She felt she was
near someone, and the path was opening into
a cleared spot that was faced around from the
other side with the low scrub pine trees.</p>

<p>“Orilla!” she said, instinctively.</p>

<p>“Nancy!” came a feeble, faint reply.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;is&mdash;she!” demanded Rosa, close
upon Nancy’s lead. “Oh, look!”</p>

<p>There she was, on a bed of pine needles,
lying like an Hawaiian under the most picturesque
hut. It was open on the side the
girls were facing, but the thatched roof fell
over the other sides in true tropical fashion.</p>

<p>“Orilla,” breathed Nancy, who was quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
beside the unhappy girl, “what has happened?”</p>

<p>“I’m sick, Nancy,” she replied, “too sick to
walk and&mdash;and&mdash;I’ve been lying here&mdash;so
long!”</p>

<p>“You want a drink, Orilla,” insisted Rosa,
all excitement now. “Here’s your tin cup,
but your water pail is&mdash;empty!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I couldn’t get to the spring&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The boatman may have some drinking
water,” Dell suggested. “Give me the pail,
Rosa.”</p>

<p>Immediately they set about to care for the
sick girl, stifling their natural curiosity at the
strange surroundings.</p>

<p>“Don’t go away, Nancy,” Orilla begged, as
Nancy rose from her side to attend to something.
“As I lay here I have been thinking of
so many things. Just let me have a drink,
Dell. Thank <em>you</em> for coming,” she said, noticing
Dell Durand’s kind attention. “I’m not
worth all this bother.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” ordered Nancy, “you don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
us crying, do you? When folks talk that
way&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s so like a funeral,” spoke up the impulsive
Rosa, who was secretly looking over
the hut, mystified and astounded.</p>

<p>“You had better not talk now,” Nancy
cautioned Orilla.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must; I’m not so very sick, just weak
and worried, and I’ll be better when I’ve told
you,” Orilla insisted. “Girls, this is the camp
I was building,” she began. “You see, my
father was a carpenter and I love even the
scent of freshly cut wood.”</p>

<p>A smile twisted Rosa’s face at this, but she
quickly conquered it. She had disastrously
followed Orilla in her quest for freshly cut
wood.</p>

<p>“Yes, I always carried home chips,” Orilla
went on, having risen on her queer bed and
settled her head against an uncovered pine
pillow. “When I was very small I would follow
the men who chopped the trees, to carry
the chips home in my little sunbonnet. I
have always loved new wood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
“This place is wonderful,” Dell interrupted.
“Just like a picture. I can’t imagine you
building it all alone. You are really a genius
at it, Orilla.”</p>

<p>“My arms are very strong&mdash;I suppose I’ve
trained them to be,” Orilla said, “but Rosa
helped me with the wood&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You bet I did,” exclaimed Rosa, “and my
hands still bear the marks.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” the sick girl continued, “I
know what an attraction a real hut in a real
woods would be, and I’ve worked at this all
summer. I was going to bring parties here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We had one of them to-day,” burst out
Nancy, and that remark brought on a hurried
report of the party just held at Fernlode.</p>

<p>“You did that! You girls!” exclaimed
Orilla, who was too surprised to lie still. She
was shifting to a sitting position, her thick,
bright hair hanging over her shoulders, adding
the last touch to her tropical appearance under
the thatched hut.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied Nancy. “It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
best fun we had this whole summer. If we
hadn’t been worrying about you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why should <em>you</em> have worried about me?”
Orilla asked, seriously.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we?” retorted Nancy.</p>

<p>“Feel better now, Orilla?” Dell inquired.
“You see, we have a hired boat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And we’ve got such glorious news, Orilla,”
sang out Rosa. “You’re coming back to live
at our house&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m&mdash;going&mdash;back!”</p>

<p>“To your own little room,” added Nancy,
smiling. “It’s all fixed. Margot thought it
only fair&mdash;”</p>

<p>The color rushed back into Orilla’s cheeks
as if it had been suddenly lighted there.</p>

<p>“My room! Back to my own&mdash;little&mdash;room!”</p>

<p>“These little girls are like fairies, aren’t
they?” Dell interposed. “But not more magical
than you have been, Orilla. This place is
perfect. Good enough for a fancy picture!”</p>

<p>“If only my mother and her library friends
could see it,” Nancy commented. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
where ever did you get these queer things?
Just look at that East Indian water jug. Isn’t
it one, Orilla?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I found most of them in a curio
shop. I think they came from an old seaman’s
collection,” and the girl on the pine-needle
bed smiled. “But how lovely it is to
have someone see them besides me!” Orilla
sighed. “I had planned this so long and made
such a secret of it, I just didn’t seem to know
how to tell anyone about it. But I’m so
glad&mdash;now!”</p>

<p>“So are we,” declared Rosa. “And I’ll tell
you, Orilla. You and I had best never have
any more secrets. Nancy would find them
out, at any rate, so what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“We must go,” announced Dell. “Orilla,
do you feel strong enough to walk down to the
boat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m much better. I guess I just
fretted myself ill, and when I thought no help
would come I sort of collapsed.”</p>

<p>“Lean on me,” commanded Rosa grandly.
“You’re going to live at our house now, so you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
will be my guest, sort of,” she said humorously.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that,” demurred Orilla, and
the puzzled look on her drawn face showed
how surprised she really was.</p>

<p>Presently they were going toward the boat,
Orilla leaning on Dell and Rosa, for she was
quite weak and the rough path was not easy to
traverse.</p>

<p>“You have fever,” Dell said gently. “If we
had not found you, what would you have
done?”</p>

<p>“Died perhaps,” Orilla answered, simply.</p>

<p>“But we were <em>sure</em> to find you,” Nancy insisted.
“Don’t you hate to leave your rustic
bower? Even your room in Fernlode could
never be as lovely as that camp. I’ve seen
pictures like it in the Geographical, but I never
expected to visit one in reality,” she enthused.</p>

<p>“We’ll come back,” chanted Rosa, “and
bring parties of our own. Won’t the boys
howl?”</p>

<p>“Step in, please,” the boatman ordered, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
they had reached the edge. “It’s getting
late.”</p>

<p>Once seated in the boat the girls did what
they could to make Orilla more presentable.
They pinned up her hair, fixed the rough
khaki blouse, and Nancy insisted upon contributing
her tie, although Orilla protested
that a tie was not necessary for her to wear,
she never did so, she declared. But the bright
little tie improved her looks, they were all
quite positive of that.</p>

<p>The transfer from boat to auto was made
easily, as Orilla, who was perhaps more frightened
at finding herself ill and being alone in
the camp than actually sick, seemed much
better and expressed keen interest in all the
girls’ prattle.</p>

<p>“Like a real story,” Nancy thrilled. “I’ll
have to tell it hundreds of times to Ted, I
know,” she laughed happily, for she expected
soon to have that welcome privilege.</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s stop at your mother’s now,”
proposed Rosa. “We can come straight back
and fetch her up after you get installed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Orilla. Margot has been frightfully busy, but
she promised to have the room aired and
everything,” she added sagely.</p>

<p>This plan was quickly agreed upon, and
when Dell drew her car up alongside of the
porch, Orilla seemed almost too dazed to step
out.</p>

<p>“Home, James!” joked Rosa, jumping
around gayly. “Fernlode is going to have
three girls now instead of just me.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll soon be going home,” Nancy told
her, while they all, including Dell, marched
along the porch with Orilla.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Nancy,” begged Rosa.
“If I weren’t going to school I wouldn’t let you
go. This way, Orilla. We’re going in the
front door this time.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t, I would so much rather not,”
murmured Orilla. “I love the way I’ve always
gone in&mdash;and&mdash;I’m sort of nervous, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Orilla’s right, Rosa,” Dell replied. “It’s
much better just to get her quietly into bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Don’t make the least fuss&mdash;” she cautioned
aside to the two eager girls.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” sighed Orilla. “You see, I can’t
help feeling a little guilty, Rosa. I did fool
you an awful lot.” There was the flash of a
smile with this admission.</p>

<p>“Not such an awful lot, either,” Rosa defended
herself, “for all the exercise was surely
good for me. See how frail and fairy-like I
am!” and she attempted a little demonstration.</p>

<p>“Just open that door, will you?” Nancy
ordered. “We’ll admire <em>you</em> some other time,
dear.”</p>

<p>Dell had hurried inside to bring the news
quietly to Margot, and to tell her of Orilla’s
weakened condition. Promptly and in her
own capable way, Margot slipped into the
hidden room, quite as if its blinds had not
been closed for so long, or as if the mustiness
she had fought for two days to conquer, were
merely a new brand of natural perfume.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to install Orilla in
her bed, which had been made fresh and comfortable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and upon Margot’s orders Rosa and
Dell then withdrew.</p>

<p>They were really going for Dr. Easton, although
they did not let Orilla know that. But
Nancy stayed near the sick girl, who seemed
still anxious to talk of her secrets.</p>

<p>“The money, you know, Nancy,” she said,
when Margot had left for some fresh water.
“I had saved that to buy the little lot next
here.”</p>

<p>“Next here?” queried Nancy, again much
perplexed at Orilla’s statement.</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s a strip of land adjoining
this. It is only a fisherman’s place and he
promised to sell it to me very cheap. I had
almost enough money, and the fresh-air parties
were to pay me more. But I won’t need
it now. This is&mdash;so&mdash;much better,” and the
sick girl sighed happily.</p>

<p>“You were trying so hard to get money to
buy land near here,” Nancy repeated, beginning
to understand Orilla’s struggles.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s in the little brown bag, but half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of it belongs to Rosa. She must have it
back,” Orilla said firmly.</p>

<p>“But I’m sure she won’t take it&mdash;” declared
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to give it to mother. Poor
mother, she has worked so hard,” Orilla
sighed. “But this, having me here again, will
surely make her happy.”</p>

<p>Dr. Easton found Orilla highly nervous, and
privately he told Margot and Mrs. Rigney that
the fancied injustice had so preyed upon the
girl’s mind she had been unable, for the time
being at least, to control her bitterness. This
would now be removed and so her health would
be sure to improve.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rigney had been brought back in the
car, as the girls arranged, and in spite of her
daughter’s illness they were all almost happy.</p>

<p>“It is her dream come true,” said Nancy to
Rosa. “And she has just given her mother
the brown bag with the money. She wanted
to give you half.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take a penny,” declared Rosa
sharply. “I gave her that and it’s all hers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
“That’s what I told her, Rosa,” Nancy replied.
“You won’t miss me so much now,
you’ll be so busy with all this,” she pointed
out. “I had a letter from mother today&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You can’t go home&mdash;yet,” cried Rosa
instantly. “You have got to be here when
Betty and Dad come. You must know what
they say when they see me&mdash;thin!”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
